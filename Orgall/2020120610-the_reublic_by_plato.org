#+title: The Reublic by Plato

* INTRODUCTION AND ANALYSIS
- The Republic of Plato is the longest of his works with the exception of the Laws, and is certainly the greatest of them. There are nearer approaches to modern [[file:2020120610-metaphysics.org][metaphysics]] in the [[file:2020120610-philebus.org][Philebus]] and in the [[file:2020120610-sophist.org][Sophist]]; the [[file:2020120610-politicus.org][Politicus]] or [[file:2020120610-statesman.org][Statesman]] is more ideal; the form and institutions of the State are more clearly drawn out in the Laws; as works of art, the [[file:2020120610-symposium.org][Symposium]] and the [[file:2020120610-protagoras.org][Protagoras]] are of higher excellence. But no other [[file:2020120610-dialogue.org][Dialogue]] of Plato has the same largeness of view and the same perfection of style; no other shows an equal knowledge of the world, or contains more of those thoughts which are new as well as old, and not of one age only but of all. Nowhere in Plato is there a deeper [[file:2020120610-irony.org][irony]] or a greater wealth of humour or [[file:2020120610-imagery.org][imagery]], or more [[file:2020120610-dramatic.org][dramatic]] power. Nor in any other of his writings is the attempt made to [[file:2020120610-interweave.org][interweave]] life and [[file:2020120610-speculation.org][speculation]], or to connect politics with philosophy. The Republic is the centre around which the other Dialogues may be grouped; here philosophy reaches the highest point (cp, especially in Books V, VI, VII) to which ancient thinkers ever attained. Plato among the Greeks, like Bacon among the moderns, was the first who conceived a method of knowledge, although neither of them always distinguished the bare outline or form from the [[file:2020120610-substance.org][substance]] of truth; and both of them had to be [[file:2020120610-content.org][content]] with an abstraction of science which was not yet realized. He was the greatest metaphysical genius whom the world has seen; and in him, more than in any other ancient thinker, the [[file:2020112219-germs.org][germs]] of future knowledge are contained. The sciences of logic and psychology, which have supplied so many instruments of thought to after-ages, are based upon the analyses of [[file:2020120610-socrates.org][Socrates]] and Plato. The principles of definition, the law of [[file:2020120610-contradiction.org][contradiction]], the fallacy of arguing in a circle, the distinction between the [[file:2020112210-essence.org][essence]] and accidents of a thing or notion, between means and ends, between causes and conditions; also the division of the mind into the [[file:2020120611-rational.org][rational]], [[file:2020120611-concupiscent.org][concupiscent]], and [[file:2020120611-irascible.org][irascible]] elements, or of pleasures and desires into necessary and unnecessary–these and other great forms of thought are all of them to be found in the Republic, and were probably first invented by Plato.
- The greatest of all logical truths, and the one of which writers on philosophy are most [[file:2020120708-apt.org][apt]] to lose sight, the difference between words and things, has been most [[file:2020120708-strenuously.org][strenuously]] insisted on by him (cp. Rep.; Polit.; Cratyl), although he has not always avoided the confusion of them in his own writings (e.g. Rep.). But he does not bind up truth in logical formulae,– logic is still [[file:2020120708-veiled.org][veiled]] in metaphysics; and the science which he imagines to ’[[file:2020120708-contemplate.org][contemplate]] all truth and all existence’ is very unlike the doctrine of the [[file:2020120708-syllogism.org][syllogism]] which [[file:2020120708-aristotle.org][Aristotle]] claims to have discovered (Soph. Elenchi).
- Neither must we forget that the Republic is but the third part of a still larger design which was to have included an ideal history of Athens, as well as a political and physical philosophy. The [[file:2020120708-fragment.org][fragment]] of the [[file:2020120708-critias.org][Critias]] has given birth to a world-famous fiction, second only in importance to the tale of Troy and the legend of [[file:2020120712-arthur.org][Arthur]]; and is said as a fact to have inspired some of the early navigators of the sixteenth century. This mythical tale, of which the subject was a history of the wars of the Athenians against the Island of Atlantis, is supposed to be founded upon an unfinished [[file:2020120712-poem.org][poem]] of [[file:2020120712-solon.org][Solon]], to which it would have stood in the same relation as the writings of the [[file:2020120712-logographers.org][logographers]] to the poems of Homer. It would have told of a struggle for Liberty (cp. Tim.), intended to represent the conflict of Persia and Hellas. We may judge from the [[file:2020120712-noble.org][noble]] [[file:2020120712-commencement.org][commencement]] of the [[file:2020120712-timaeus.org][Timaeus]], from the fragment of the Critias itself, and from the third book of the Laws, in what manner Plato would have treated this high argument. We can only guess why the great design was abandoned; perhaps because Plato became sensible of some [[file:2020120712-incongruity.org][incongruity]] in a [[file:2020120721-fictitious.org][fictitious]] history, or because he had lost his interest in it, or because advancing years [[file:2020120721-forbade.org][forbade]] the completion of it; and we may please ourselves with the fancy that had this imaginary narrative ever been finished, we should have found Plato himself sympathising with the struggle for Hellenic independence (cp. Laws), singing a [[file:2020120721-hymn.org][hymn]] of [[file:2020120721-triumph.org][triumph]] over Marathon and [[file:2020120721-salamis.org][Salamis]], perhaps making the reflection of Herodotus where he [[file:2020120721-contemplates.org][contemplates]] the growth of the Athenian empire–’How brave a thing is freedom of speech, which has made the Athenians so far exceed every other state of [[file:2020120721-hellas.org][Hellas]] in greatness! or, more probably, attributing the victory to the ancient good order of Athens and to the [[file:2020120721-favor.org][favor]] of Apollo and Athene (cp. Introd. to Critias).
- Again, Plato may be regarded as the ’captain’ (’arhchegoz’) or leader of a goodly band of followers; for in the Republic is to be found the original of Cicero’s De Republica, of St. Augustine’s City of God, of the Utopia of Sir Thomas More, and of the numerous other imaginary States which are framed upon the same model. The extent to which [[file:2020120708-aristotle.org][Aristotle]] or the Aristotelian school were [[roam:indebted]] to him in the Politics has been little recognised, and the recognition is the mo- re necessary because it is not made by Aristotle himself. The two philosophers had more in common than they were conscious of; and probably some elements of Plato remain still undetected in Aristotle. In English philosophy too, many affinities may be traced, not only in the works of the Cambridge Platonists,but in great original writers like Berkeley or Coleridge, to Plato and his ideas. That there is a truth higher than experience, of which the mind bears witness to herself, is a conviction which in our own generation has been enthusiastically asserted, and is perhaps gaining ground. Of the Greek authors who at the Re- naissance brought a new life into the world Plato has had the greatest influence. The Republic of Plato is also the first treatise upon education, of which the wri- tings of Milton and Locke, Rousseau, Jean Paul, and Goethe are the legitimate descendants. Like Dante or Bunyan, he has a revelation of another life; like Bacon, he is profoundly impressed with the unity of knowledge; in the early Church he exercised a real influence on theology, and at the Revival of Literatu- re on politics. Even the fragments of his words when ’repeated at second-hand’ (Symp.) have in all ages ravished the hearts of men, who have seen reflected in them their own higher nature. He is the father of idealism in philosophy, in po- litics, in literature. And many of the latest conceptions of modern thinkers and statesmen, such as the unity of knowledge, the reign of law, and the equality of the sexes, have been anticipated in a dream by him.
- The argument of the Republic is the search after Justice, the nature of which is first hinted at by Cephalus, the just and blameless old man–then discussed on the basis of proverbial morality by Socrates and Polemarchus– then caricatured by Thrasymachus and partially explained by Socrates– reduced to an abstracti- on by Glaucon and Adeimantus, and having become invisible in the individual reappears at length in the ideal State which is constructed by Socrates. The first care of the rulers is to be education, of which an outline is drawn after the old Hellenic model, providing only for an improved religion and morality, and mo- re simplicity in music and gymnastic, a manlier strain of poetry, and greater harmony of the individual and the State. We are thus led on to the concepti- on of a higher State, in which ’no man calls anything his own,’ and in which there is neither ’marrying nor giving in marriage,’ and ’kings are philosophers’ and ’philosophers are kings;’ and there is another and higher education, intel- lectual as well as moral and religious, of science as well as of art, and not of youth only but of the whole of life. Such a State is hardly to be realized in this world and quickly degenerates. To the perfect ideal succeeds the government of the soldier and the lover of honour, this again declining into democracy, and democracy into tyranny, in an imaginary but regular order having not much resemblance to the actual facts. When ’the wheel has come full circle’ we do not begin again with a new period of human life; but we have passed from the best to the worst, and there we end. The subject is then changed and the old quar- rel of poetry and philosophy which had been more lightly treated in the earlier books of the Republic is now resumed and fought out to a conclusion. Poetry is discovered to be an imitation thrice removed from the truth, and Homer, as well as the dramatic poets, having been condemned as an imitator, is sent into banishment along with them. And the idea of the State is supplemented by the revelation of a future life.
