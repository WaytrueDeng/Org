** Noncoding DNA
** Histone Organization
** Micro-RNA and Long Noncoding RNA
*** Micro-RNAs
1. 22 nucleotides on average
2. Posttranscriptional silencing of gene expression by miRNA is a fundamental a and e evolutionanarily conserved machnism of gene regulation present in all eukaryotes.
*** Long-noncoding RNA
** Gene Editing
* Cellualar Housekeeping
Many normal housekeeping functions are compartmentalized within membrane-bound intracellular organelles.
** Breakdown of these constinuents takes place at three different sites
