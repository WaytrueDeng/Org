**** Origin and relative words
***** depends how you turn
- √verto to turn
- the prefix ambi- also found in [[file:2020112110-ambidexterity.org][ambidexterity]]
  - [[file:2020112110-dexterous.org][dexterous]] means skillful, the noun [[file:2020112110-dexterity.org][dexterity]] is skill.
  - [[file:2020112110-dexter.org][dexter]] is a latin word for right hand, in the [[file:2020112110-ambidextrous.org][ambidextrous]] person both hands are right hands.
  - [[file:2020112110-left_handed.org][left-handed]] is still the synonym of awkward
  - the Latin word for the left hand is [[file:2020112110-sinister.org][sinister]]
  - The French word for the left hand is [[file:2020112110-gauche.org][gauche]]. A [[file:2020112110-gauche.org][gauche]] remark is [[file:2020112110-tactless.org][tactless]]. A [[file:2020112110-gauche.org][gauche]] offer of a sympathy is so [[file:2020112020-bumbling.org][bumbling]] to be embarassing. [[file:2020112110-gaucherie.org][gaucherie]] is an awkward, [[file:2020112110-clumsy.org][clumsy]], [[file:2020112110-tactless.org][tactless]], embarrassing way of saying things or of handling situation. The [[file:2020112110-gauche.org][gauche]] person is totally without [[file:2020112110-finesse.org][finesse]].
  - And the French word for the right hand is [[file:2020112110-droit.org][droit]], which we have used in building our English word adroit ( a-DROYT'). Needless to say, adroit, like dexterous, means skillful, but especially in the exercise of the mental [[file:2020112110-facilities.org][facilities]]. Like gauche, adroit, or its [[file:2020112110-nounadroitness.org][nounadroitness]], usually is used [[file:2020112110-figuratively.org][figuratively]]. The adroit person is quick-witted, can get out of difficult spots cleverly, can handle situations [[file:2020112110-ingeniously.org][ingeniously]]. Adroitness is, then, quite the opposite of gaucherie.
***** love,hate,and marriage
****** √misein to hate
Misanthrope, misogynist, and misogamist are built on the Greek root ~misein~, to hate. The misanthrope hates mankind (Greek ~anthropos~, mankind); the misogynist hates women (Greek ~gyne~, woman); the misogamist hates marriage (Greek ~gamos~, marriage). Anthropos, mankind, is also found in [[file:2020112110-anthropology.org][anthropology]] (an-thra-POL'-a-jee), the study of the development of the human race; and in [[file:2020112110-philanthropist.org][philanthropist]] (fa-LAN'-thra-pist), one who loves man-kind and shows such love by making [[file:2020112110-substantial.org][substantial]] financial contributions to charitable organizations or by donating time and energy to helping those in need. The root gyne, woman, is also found in [[file:2020112110-gynecologist.org][gynecologist]]  jin· -KOL'-a-jist, the medical specialis treats female disorders. And the root gamos, marriage, occurs also in [[file:2020112110-monogamy.org][monogamy]] (rna-NOG'-a-mee), [[file:2020112110-bigamy.org][bigamy]] (BIG'-a-rnee), and [[file:2020112110-polygamy.org][polygamy]] (pa-LIG'-a-mee). (As we will discover later, monos means one, bi- means two, polys means many.)
So monogamy is the custom of only one marriage (at a time).
Bigamy, by etymology, is two marriages-in actuality, the unlawful act of contracting another marriage without divorcing one's current legal spouse.
And polygamy, by derivation many marriages, and therefore etymologically [[file:2020112111-denoting.org][denoting]] [[file:2020112111-plural.org][plural]] marriage for either males or females, in current usage generally refers to the custom practiced in earlier times by the [[file:2020112111-mormons.org][Mormons]], and before them by King Solomon, in which the man has as many wives as he can afford financially and/or emotionally. The correct, but rarely used, term for this custom is polygyny (p;;i-LIJ'-a-nee)-polys, many, plus gyne,woman.
What if a woman has two or more husbands, a form of marriage practiced in the Himalaya Mountains of Tibet? That custom is called [[file:2020112111-polyandry.org][polyandry]] (pol-ee-AN'-dree), from polys plus Greek
~andros~, male.
***** making friends with suffixes
***** living alone and liking it √asketes
[[file:2020112111-ascetic.org][Ascetic]] is from the Greek word ~asketes~, monk or hermit.
A monk lives a lonely life-not for him the pleasures of the fleshpots, the [[file:2020112111-laughter.org][laughter]] and [[file:2020112111-merriment.org][merriment]] of [[file:2020112111-convivial.org][convivial]] gatherings, the [[file:2020112111-dissipation.org][dissipation]] of high living. Rather, days of contemplation, study, and rough [[file:2020112111-toil.org][toil]], nights on a hard bed in a simple cell, and the kind of self-denial that leads to a [[file:2020112111-purification.org][purification]] of the soul.
That person is an ascetic who leads an existence, voluntarily of course, that compares in [[file:2020112111-austerity.org][austerity]], simplicity, and [[file:2020112111-rigorous.org][rigorous]] hardship with the life of a monk.
The practice is [[file:2020112111-asceticism.org][asceticism]] (a-SET'-;l-siz-am), the adjective ascetic.

*** ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS
**** inside you
Internist and internal derive from the same Latin root, ~internus~, inside. The internist is a specialist in internal medicine, in the exploration of your insides. This physician determines the state of your internal organs in order to discover what's happening within your body to cause the troubles you're complaining of. Do not confuse the internist with the [[file:2020112210-intern.org][intern]] (also spelled interne), who is a medical graduate serving an [[file:2020112210-apprenticeship.org][apprenticeship]] inside a hospital

**** doctors for women
The word [[file:2020112110-gynecologist.org][gynecologist]] is built on Greek ~gyne~, woman, plus ~logos~, science; etymologically, gynecology is the science (in actual use, the medical science) of women. [[file:2020112210-adjective.org][Adjective]]: gynecological (gin [or jin or jinJ-a-kQ-LOJ'-a-kal). [[file:2020112210-obstetrician.org][Obstetrician]] derives from Latin ~obstetrix~, midwife, which in turn has its source in a Latin verb meaning to stand-midwives stand in front of the woman in labor to aid in the delivery of the infant. The suffix ~-ician~, as in obstetrician, physician, musician, magi- cian, electrician, etc., means expert. Obstetrics (ob-STET'-riks) has only within the last 150 years become a respectable specialty. No further back than 1834, Professor William P. Dewees [[file:2020112210-assumed.org][assumed]] the first chair of obstetrics at the University of Pennsylvania and had to brave considerable medical contempt and [[file:2020112210-ridicule.org][ridicule]] as a result-the delivery of children was then considered beneath the [[file:2020112108-dignity.org][dignity]] of the medical profession. Adjective: obstetric (ob-STET'-rik) or obstetrical (ob-STET'- ra-kal).

**** children
Pediatrician is a combination of Greek ~paidos~, child; ~iatreia~, medical healing; and -ician, expert. · Pediatrics (pee-dee-AT'-riks), then, is by etymology the medical healing of a child. Adjective: pediatric (pee-dee-AT'-rik). (The ped- you see in words like [[file:2020112210-pedestal.org][pedestal]], [[file:2020112210-pedal.org][pedal]], and [[file:2020112210-pedestrian.org][pedestrian]] is from the Latin ~pedis~, foot, and [[file:2020112210-despite.org][despite]] the identical spelling in English has no relationship to Greek ~paidos~.) [[file:2020112210-pedagogy.org][Pedagogy]] (PED-a-go'-jee), which combines ~paidos~ with ~agogos~, leading; is, etymologically, the leading of children. And to what do you lead them? To learning, to development, to growth, to maturity. From the moment of birth, infants are led by adults- they are taught, first by parents and then by teachers, to be self-sufficient, to *fit into* the culture in which they are born. Hence, pedagogy, which by derivation means the leading of a child, refers actually to the principles and methods of teaching. College students majoring in education take certain standard pedagogy courses-the history of education; educational psychology; the psychology of [[file:2020112210-adolescents.org][adolescents]]; principles of teaching; etc. Adjective: pedagogical (ped-a-GOJ'-a-kal). A pedagogue (PED'-:i-gog) is versed in pedagogy. But [[file:2020112210-pedagogue.org][pedagogue]] has an unhappy history. From its original, neutral meaning of teacher, it has deteriorated to the point where it refers, today, to *a* *narrow-minded*,[[file:2020112210-strait_laced.org][strait-laced]] ,old-fashioned, [[file:2020112210-dogmatic.org][dogmatic]] teacher. It is a word of contempt and should be used with caution. Like. pedagogue, [[file:2020112210-demagogue.org][demagogue]] (DEM'-a-gog) has also deteriorated in meaning. By derivation a leader (agogos) of the people (~demos~), a demagogue today is actually one who attempts, in [[file:2020112210-essence.org][essence]], to mislead the people, a politician who foments discontent among the masses, [[file:2020112210-rousing.org][rousing]] them to fever [[file:2020112210-pitch.org][pitch]] by wild [[file:2020112210-oratory.org][oratory]], in an attempt to be voted into office. Once elected, demagogues use political power to further their
own personal ambitions or fortunes. Many "leaders" of the past and present, in countries around the world, have been [[file:2020112210-accused.org][accused]] of demagoguery ( dem-a-(]OG' -a-ree) . Adjective: demagogic (dem-a-GOJ'-ik).
**** skin-deep
The [[file:2020112209-dermatologist.org][dermatologist]], whose specialty is dermatology ( dur-ma- TOL'-a-jee), is so named from Greek ~derma~, skin. Adjective: dermatological ( dur'-ma-ta-LOJ'-a-kal). See the syllables derma in any English word and you will know there is some reference to skin-for example, a [[file:2020112210-hypodermic.org][hypodermic]] . (hi~ pa-DUR'..,mik) needle [[file:2020112210-penetrates.org][penetrates]] under (Greek, ~hypos~) the skin,· the [[file:2020112210-epidermis.org][epidermis]] (ep-:i-DUR'-mis) ·is the outermost layer of skin; a [[file:2020112210-taxidermist.org][taxidermist]] (TAKS'-a-dur-mist), whose business is [[file:2020112210-taxidermy.org][taxidermy]] (TAKS'-a-dur-mee), prepares, stuffs, and mounts the skins of animals; a [[file:2020112210-pachyderm.org][pachyderm]] (PAK'-a-durm) is an animal with an unusually [[file:2020112210-thick.org][thick]] skin, like an elephant, [[file:2020112210-hippopotamus.org][hippopotamus]], or [[file:2020112210-rhinoceros.org][rhinoceros]]; and [[file:2020112210-dermatitis.org][dermatitis]] (dur-ma-Ti'-tis) is the general name for any skin inflammation, [[file:2020112210-irritation.org][irritation]], or infection.
**** the eyes have it
Ophthalmologist-note the ph preceding th-is from Greek ~ophthalmos~, eye, plus ~·logos~, science or study. The specialty is ophthalmology (off'-thal-MOU-a-jee), the adjective ophthal-mological ( off'-thal-ma-LOJ'-a-kal). An earlier title for this physician, still occasionally used, is ocu- list (OK'-ya-list), from Latin [[file:2020112210-oculus.org][oculus]], eye, a root on which the following English words are also built:
1. [[file:2020112210-ocular.org][ocular]] (OK'-ya-Iar)-an adjective that refers to the eye
2. [[file:2020112210-monocle.org][monocle]] (MON'-a-kal)-a lens for one (monos) eye, sported by characters in old movies as a symbol of the British so-called upper class
3. [[file:2020112210-binoculars.org][binoculars]] (ba-NOK'-ya-larz)-field glasses that increase the range of two (bi-) eyes
4. And, strangely enough, [[file:2020112210-inoculate.org][inoculate]] (in-OK'-ya-layt'), a word commonly [[file:2020112210-misspelled.org][misspelled]] with two n's. When you are inoculated against a disease, an "eye," [[file:2020112210-puncture.org][puncture]], or hole is made in your skin, through which [[file:2020112210-serum.org][serum]] is injected. Do not confuse the ophthalmologist or oculist, a medical specialist, with two other [[file:2020112210-practitioners.org][practitioners]] who deal with the eye-the [[file:2020112210-optometrist.org][optometrist]] (op-TOM'-a-trist) and [[file:2020112210-optician.org][optician]] (op-TISH'-an). Optometrists are not [[file:2020112210-physicians.org][physicians]], and do not perform surgery or administer drugs; they measure vision, test for [[file:2020112209-glaucoma.org][glaucoma]], and prescribe and fit glasses. Opticians fill an optometrist's or ophthalmologist's prescription, [[file:2020112211-grinding.org][grinding]] lenses according to specifications; they do not [[file:2020112211-examine.org][examine]] patients. Optometrist combines Greek ~opsis~, ~optikos~, sight or vision, with ~metron~, measurement .the optometrist, by etyi:pology, is one who measures vision. The specialty is [[file:2020112211-optometry.org][optometry]] (op-TOM'-a-tree).
Optician is built on opsis, optikos, plus -ician, expert. The specialty is optics (OP'-tiks). Adjectives: optometric ( op-ta-MET'-rik) or optometrical (op- ta-MET'-ra-kal), optical (OP'-ta-kal).

**** ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS
***** the straighteners
The [[file:2020112209-orthopedist.org][orthopedist]] is so called from the Greek roots ~orthos~, straight or correct, and ~paidos~, child. The orthopedist, by etymology, [[file:2020112215-straightens.org][straightens]] children. The term was [[file:2020112215-coined.org][coined]] in 1741 by the author of a textbook on the [[file:2020112215-prevention.org][prevention]] of childhood diseases-at that time the correction of spinal [[file:2020112209-curvature.org][curvature]] in children was a main concern of practitioners of orthopedics ( awr-tha-PEE' -diks). Today the specialty treats [[file:2020112215-deformities.org][deformities]], [[file:2020112215-injuries.org][injuries]], and diseases of the bones and joints (of adults as well as children, of course), often by surgical procedures. Adjective: orthopedic (awr-tha-PEE'-dik). [[file:2020112215-orthodontia.org][Orthodontia]] (awr-tha-DON'-sha), the straightening of teeth, is built on ~orthos~ plus ~odontos~, tooth. The [[file:2020112215-orthodontist.org][orthodontist]] (aWl'-tha- DON'-tist) specializes in improving your "bite," retracting "[[file:2020112215-buck_teeth.org][buck teeth]]," and by means of braces and other techniques seeing to it
that every [[file:2020112215-molar.org][molar]], [[file:2020112215-incisor.org][incisor]], [[file:2020112215-bicuspid.org][bicuspid]], etc. is exactly where it belongs in your mouth.
Adjective: orthodontic (awr-tha-DON'-tik).
***** the heart
[[file:2020112215-cardiologist.org][Cardiologist]] combines Greek ~kardia~, heart, and ~logos~, science.
The specialty is cardiology (kahr-dee-OL'-a-jee), the adjective cardiological (kahr'-dee-a-LOJ'-a-kal).
So a cardiac (KAHR'-dee-ak) condition refers to some malfunctioning of the heart; a cardiogram (KAHR'-dee-a-gram') is an electrically produced record of the heartbeat. The instrument that produces this record is called a cardiograph (KAHR'-dee-a- graf').
***** the nervous system
Neurologist derives from Greek ~neuron~, nerve, plus logos, sci-
ence.
Specialty: neurology (noor-OL'-a-jee); adjective: neurological
(noor-a-LOJ'-a-kal).
[[file:2020112215-neuralgia.org][Neuralgia]] (noor-AL'-ja) is acute pain along the nerves and
their branches; the word comes from neuron plus ~algos~, pain.
[[file:2020112215-neuritis.org][Neuritis]] (noor-1'-tis), is [[file:2020112215-inflammation.org][inflammation]] of the nerves.
[[file:2020112215-neurosis.org][Neurosis]] (noor-0'-sis), combining neuron with ~-osis~, a ~suffix~ meaning abnormal or diseased condition, is not, [[file:2020112210-despite.org][despite]] its etymology, a disorder of the nerves, but rather, as· described by the late Eric Berne, a psychiatrist, "... an illness characterized by excessive use of energy for unproductive purposes so that personality development is [[file:2020112215-hindered.org][hindered]] or stopped. A man who spends most of his time worrying about his health, counting his money, [[file:2020112215-plotting.org][plotting]] revenge, or washing his  hands, can hope for little emotional growth." .
Neurotic (m;lOr-OT'-ik) is both the adjective form and the term
for a person suffering from neurosis.
***** the mind
A neurosis is not a form of mental unbalance. A full-blown mental disorder is called a [[file:2020112215-psychosis.org][psychosis]] (si-KO'-sis), a word built on Greek ~psyche~, spirit, soul, or mind, plus -osis. A true psychotic (si-KOT'-ik) has lost contact with reality-at least with reality as most of us [[file:2020112215-perceive.org][perceive]] it, though no doubt psychotic (note that this word, h"ke neurotic, is both a noun and an adjective) people have their own form of reality. Built on psyche plus ~iatreia~, medical healing, a psychiatrist by etymology is a mind-healer. The specialty is psychiatry (si- or sa- Kf-tree); the adjective is psychiatric (si~kee-AT'-rik).
[[file:2020112215-pediatrics.org][Pediatrics]], as you know, is also built on ~iatreia~, as is [[file:2020112215-podiatry.org][podiatry]] (p~-Df'-::>-tree), discussed, in the next chapter, and [[file:2020112215-geriatrics.org][geriatrics]]
(jair'-ee-AT'-riks), the specialty dealing with the particular medi-
cal needs of the elderly. (This word combines iatreia with. Greek
ge.ras, old age.)
The specialist is a geriatrician (jair'-ee-::>-TRISH'-~n), the ad-
jective is geriatric (jair'-ee-AT'-rik).

**** TWO KEYS TO. SUCCESS: SELF-DISCIPLINE AND PERSISTENCE
You can achieve a [[file:2020112216-superior.org][superior]] vocabulary in a [[file:2020112216-phenomenally.org][phenomenally]] short time-given self-discipline and persistence.
The greatest [[file:2020112216-aid.org][aid]] in building self-discipline is, as I have said, a matter of devising a practical and comfortable schedule for yourself and then keeping to that schedule.
 Make sure to complete at least one session each time you pick up the book, and always decide exactly when you will continue with your work before you put the book down.
There may be periods of difficulty-then is the time to exert the greatest self-discipline, the most determined persistence.
For every page that you study will help you [[file:2020112216-attain.org][attain]] a mastery over words; every day that you work will add to your skill in understanding and using words.

* Brief Intermission Two
** RANDOM NOTES ON MODERN USAGE
English grammar is confusing enough as it is-what makes it doubly confounding is that it is slowly but continually changing. •
This means that some of the strict rules you memorized so painfully in your high school or college English courses may no longer be completely valid.
Following such outmoded principles, you may think you are speaking "perfect" English, and instead you may sound [[file:2020112216-stuffy.org][stuffy]] and [[file:2020112216-pedantic.org][pedantic]].
The problem boils down to this: If grammatical usage is gradually becoming more liberal, where does educated, unaffected, informal speech end? And where does illiterate, ungrammatical speech begin?
The following notes on current trends in modem usage are intended to help you come to a decision about certain [[file:2020112216-controversial.org][controversial]] expressions. As you read each sentence, pay particular attention to the italicized word or words. Does the usage [[file:2020112216-square.org][square]] with your own language patterns? Would you be willing to phrase your thought in just terms? Decide whether the sentence is right or wrong, then compare your conclusion with the opinion given in the explanatory paragraphs that follow the test.

* HOW TO TALK ABOUT VARIOUS PRACTITIONERS
** SESSION 7
An ancient Greek [[file:2020112217-mused.org][mused]] about the meaning of life, and philosophy was born. The first Roman decided fo build a road instead of cutting a path through the jungle, and engineering came into existence. One day in [[file:2020112217-primitive.org][primitive]] times, a human being [[roam:lent]] to another whatever then passed for money and got back his original investment plus a little more-and banking had started.
Most people Spend part of every workday at some gainful employment, honest or otherwise, and in so doing often contribute their little [[file:2020112217-mite.org][mite]] to the progress of the world.
We explore in this chapter the ideas behind people's occupations-and the words that translate these ideas into verbal symbols.
*** IDEAS
**** behavior
By education and training, this practitioner is an expert in the dark mysteries of human behavior-what makes people act as they do, why they have certain feelings, how their personalities were formed-in short, what makes them [[file:2020112217-tick.org][tick]]. Such a professional , is often employed by industries, schools, and institutions to devise  means for keeping workers productive and happy, students well-adjusted, and inmates contented. With a state license, this person may also do private or group therapy.
A [[file:2020112217-psychologist.org][psychologist]]

**** worries, fears, conflicts
This practitioner is a physician, psychiatrist, or psychologist who has been specially trained in the [[file:2020112217-techniques.org][techniques]] devised by Sigmund Freud, encouraging you to [[file:2020112217-delve.org][delve]] into that part of your mind called "the unconscious." By reviewing the experiences, [[roam:traumas]], feelings, and thoughts of your earlier years, you come to a better understanding of your present worries, fears, conflicts, repressions, insecurities, and nervous tensions-thus taking the first step in coping with them. Treatment, consisting largely in listening to, and helping you to [[file:2020112217-interpret.org][interpret]] the meaning of, your free-flowing ideas, is usually given in frequent sessions that may well go on for a year or more.

Still [[file:2020112217-devised.org][devised]] a drugless technique of curing diseases by massage and other manipulative procedures, a technique based on the theory that illness may be caused by the undue pressure of displaced bones on nerves and blood vessels. Training is equal to that of physicians, and in most states these practitioners may also use the same methods as, and have the full rights and privileges of medical doctors.

** SESSION 8
*** ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS
**** the mental life
- Psychologist is built upon the same Greek root as psychiatrist-~psyche~, spirit, soul, or mind. In psychiatrist, the combining form is ~iatreia~, medical healing. In psychologist, the combining form is ~logos~, science or study; a psychologist, by etynmology, is one who studies the mind.
- The field is psychology (si-KOL'-~jee), the adjective psychological (si'-k~LOJ'-a-kal).
- [[file:2020112218-psyche.org][Psyche]] (SI'-kee) is also an English word in its own right..:._it designates the mental life, the spiritual or non-physical [[file:2020112020-aspect.org][aspect]] of one's existence. The adjective psychic (SI'-kik) refers to [[file:2020112218-phenomena.org][phenomena]] or qualities that cannot be explained in purely physical terms. People may be called psychic if they seem to possess a sixth sense, a special gift of mind reading, or any mysterious [[file:2020112217-aptitudes.org][aptitudes]] that cannot be accounted for logically. A person's [[file:2020112218-disturbance.org][disturbance]] is psychic if ii is emotional or mental, rather than physical.
- Psyche combines with the Greek ~pathos~, suffering or disease, to form [[file:2020112218-psychopathic.org][psychopathic]] (si-ka-PATH'-ik), an adjective that describes someone suffering from a severe mental or emotional disorder. The noun is psychopathy (sI'-KOP'~thee).*
- The root psyche combines with Greek ~soma~, body, to form psychosomatic (si'-ko-s::i-MAT'-ik), an adjective that [[file:2020112219-delineates.org][delineates]] the powerful influence that the mind, especially the unconscious, has on bodily diseases. Thus, a person who fears the consequence of being present at a certain meeting will suddenly develop a bad cold or backache, or even be injured in a traffic accident, so that his appearance at this meeting is made impossible. It's a real cold, it's far from [[file:2020112219-ari.org][ari]] imaginary backache, and of course one cannot in any sense doubt the reality of the automobile that injured him. Yet, according to the psychosomatic theory of medicine, his unconscious made him [[file:2020112219-susceptible.org][susceptible]] to the cold [[file:2020112219-germs.org][germs]], caused the backache, or forced him into the path of the car.
- A [[file:2020112219-psychosomatic.org][psychosomatic]] disorder actually exists [[file:2020112219-insofar.org][insofar]] as symptoms are concerned (headache, excessive urination, pains, paralysis, heart [[file:2020112219-palpitations.org][palpitations]]), yet there is no organic cause within the body. The cause is within the psyche, the mind. Dr. Flanders Dunbar, in Mind and Body, gives a clear and exciting account of the inter relationship between emotions and diseases.
- Psychoanalysis (si'-ko-a-NAL'-a-sis) relies on the [[file:2020112219-technique.org][technique]] of deeply, exhaustively [[file:2020112219-probing.org][probing]] into the unconscious, a technique developed by Sigmund Freud. In oversimplified terms, the general principle of psychoanalysis is to guide the patient to an awareness of the deep-seated, unconscious causes of anxieties, fears, conflicts, and tension. Once fourtd, exposed to the light of day, and [[file:2020112219-thoroughly.org][thoroughly]] understood, claim the psychoanalysts, these causes may [[file:2020112219-vanish.org][vanish]] like a light snow that is exposed to strong sunlight
- Consider an example: You have [[file:2020112219-asthma.org][asthma]], let us say, and your doctor can find no physical [[file:2020112219-basis.org][basis]] for your ailment. So you are referred to a psychoanalyst (or psychiatrist or clinical psychologist who practices psychoanalytically oriented therapy).
- With your therapist you explore your past life, dig into your un conscious, and discover, let us say for th~ sake of argument, that your mother or father always used to set for you impossibly high goals. No matter what you accomplished in school, it was not good enough in your mother's or father's opinion (and such opinions were always made painfully clear to you), you could do better if you were not so lazy. As a child you built up certain [[file:2020112219-resentments.org][resentments]] and anxieties because you seemed unable to please your parent-and (this will sound [[file:2020112219-farfetched.org][farfetched]], but it is perfectly possible) as a result you became asthmatic. How else were you going to get the parental love, the [[file:2020112219-approbation.org][approbation]], the attention you needed and that you felt you were not receiving?
- In your sessions with your therapist, you discover that your asthma is emotionally, rather than organically, based-your ailment is psychogenic (sI'-ko-JEN'-ik), of Psychic origin, or (the terms are used more or less interchangeably although they [[file:2020112219-differ.org][differ]] somewhat in definition) psychosomatic, resulting from the interaction of mind and body. ([[file:2020112219-psychogenic.org][Psychogenic]] is built on psyche plus Greek ~genesis~, birth or origin.)
- And your treatment? No drugs, no surgery-these may help the body, not the emotions. Instead, you "work out" (this is the term used in psychoanalytic [si-ko-an'-a-LIT'-ik] [[file:2020112219-parlance.org][parlance]]) early [[file:2020112219-trauma.org][trauma]] in talk, in remembering, in exploring, in interpreting, in reliving childhood experiences. And if your [[file:2020112219-asthma.org][asthma]] is indeed psychogenic (or psychosomatic), therapy will very likely help you; your attacks may [[file:2020112219-cease.org][cease]], either gradually or suddenly.
- [[file:2020112219-freudian.org][Freudian]] therapy is less popular today than formerly; many newer therapies-Gestalt, bioenergetics, [[file:2020112219-transactional.org][transactional]] analysis, to name only a few-claim to produce quicker results.
- In any case, psychotherapy (si-kO-THAIR'-a-pee)_ of one sort or another is the [[file:2020112219-indicated.org][indicated]] treatment for Psychogenic (or psycho- somatic) disorders, or for any personality disturbances. The practitioner is a [[file:2020112219-psychotherapist.org][psychotherapist]] (si-ko-THAIR'-a-pist) or therapist, for short; the adjective is [[file:2020112219-psychotherapeutic.org][psychotherapeutic]] (si-ko-thair'-a- PYOO'-tik).
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[[file:2020112219-psychopathy.org][Psychopathy]] is usually [[file:2020112219-characterized.org][characterized]] by antisocial and extremely egocentric behavior. A psychopath (Sl'-ka-path'), sometimes called a psychopathic personality, appears to be lacking an inner moral censor, and often commits criminal acts, without anxiety or guilt, in order to obtain immediate [[file:2020112219-gratification.org][gratification]] of desires. Such a person may be [[file:2020112219-utterly.org][utterly]] lacking in sexual [[file:2020112219-restraint.org][restraint]], or addicted to hard drugs. Some psychologists prefer the label sociopath (SO'-shee-a-path' or SO>-see-:>-path') for this type of personality to [[file:2020112219-indicate.org][indicate]] the absence of a social [[file:2020112219-conscience.org][conscience]].

*** ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS
**** the whole tooth
- Orthodontist, as we discovered in Chapter 4, is built on ~orthos~, straight, correct, plus ~odontos~, tooth. 
- A [[file:2020112308-pedodontist.org][pedodontist]] (pee'-do-DON'-tist) specializes in the care of children's teeth-the title is constructed from ~paidos~, child, plus
~odontos~. The specialty: pedodontia (pee'-do-DON'-sha); the adjective: pedodontic (pee'-do-DON'-tik).
- A [[file:2020112308-periodontist.org][periodontist]] (pair'-ee-0-DON'-tist) is a [[file:2020112308-gum.org][gum]] specialist--=-the term combines ~odontos~ with the prefix ~peri-~, around, surrounding. (As a quick glance in the mirror will tell you, the gums surround the teeth, more or less.)
- Can you figure out the word for · the specialty?
- For the adjective? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
- An [[file:2020112308-endodontist.org][endodontist]] (en'-do-DON'-tist) specializes in work on the [[file:2020112308-pulp.org][pulp]] of the tooth and in root- ~canal~ therapy-the prefix in this term is ~endo~, from .Greek ~endon~, inner, within.
- Try your. hand again ·at .constructing words. What is the specialty? . And the adjective?
- The prefix ex-, out, combines with ~odontos~ to form [[file:2020112308-exodontist.org][exodontist]] (eks'-0-DON'-tist). What do you suppose, therefore, is the work in which this practitioner specializes? - - - - - - - - - -
- And the terin for the specialty? ----------~For the adject
****  measurement
- The [[file:2020112210-optometrist.org][optometrist]], by etymology, measures vision-the term is built on ~opsis~, ~optikos~, view, vision, plus ~metron~, measurement. Metron is the root in many other words:
- thermometer (th::ir-MOM'-G-t::ir)-an instrument to meas- ure heat (Greek therme, heat).
- [[file:2020112308-barometer.org][barometer]] (bG-ROM'-G-ter)-an instrument to measure atmospheric pressure (Greek ~baros~, weight); the adjective is barometric (bair'-G-MET'-rik).
- [[file:2020112308-sphygmomanometer.org][sphygmomanometer]] (sfig'-mo-m::i-NOM'-::i-t::ir)-a device for measuring blood pressure (Greek ~sphygmos~, pulse).
- metric system-a decimal system of weights and measures, long used in other countries and now gradually being adopted in the United States.
**** bones, feet, and hands
- [[file:2020112308-osteopath.org][Osteopath]] combines Greek ~osteon~, bone, with ~pathos~, suffering, disease. Osteopathy (os'-tee-OP'-::i-thee), you will recall, was originally based on the theory that disease is caused by pressure of the bones on blood vessels and nerves. An osteopathic (os'-tee-::i- PATH'-ik) physician is not a bone specialist, despite the misleading etymology-and should not be confused with the [[file:2020112209-orthopedist.org][orthopedist]], who is.
- The [[file:2020112217-podiatrist.org][podiatrist]] (Greek ~pous~, ~podos~, foot, plus ~iatreia~, medical healing) practices podiatry (p::i-DI'-G-tree). The adjective is po- diatric (po'-dee-A T'-rik).
- The root ~pous~, ~podos~ is found also in:
- [[file:2020112308-octopus.org][octopus]] (OK'-b-p::is), the eight-armed (or, as the etymol-ogy has it, eight-footed) sea creature (Greek ~okto~, eight).
- [[file:2020112308-platypus.org][platypus]] (PLAT'-::icp::is), the strange water mammal with a duck's [[file:2020112308-bill.org][bill]], [[file:2020112308-webbed.org][webbed]] feet, and a [[file:2020112308-beaver.org][beaver]] -like tail that reproduces by laying eggs (Greek ~platys~, broad, flat-hence, by etymology, a flatfoot!).
- podium (PO'-dee-::im), a speaker's platform, etymologically a place for the feet. (The suffix ~-ium~ often signifies "place where," as in [[file:2020112308-gymnasium.org][gymnasium]], [[file:2020112308-stadium.org][stadium]], [[file:2020112308-auditorium.org][auditorium]], etc.) 
- tripod (TRI'-pod), a three-legged (or "footed") stand for a camera or other device {tri-, three).
- [[file:2020112308-chiropodist.org][chiropodist]] (ka-ROP'-a-dist}, earlier title for a [[file:2020112217-podiatrist.org][podiatrist]], and still often used. The specialty is [[file:2020112308-chiropody.org][chiropody]] (h-ROP'-a-dee).
- [[roam:Chiropody]] combines ~podos~ with Greek ~cheir~, hand, spelled chiro- in English words. The term was coined in the days before labor-saving machinery and push-button devices, when people worked with their hands and developed [[file:2020112217-calluses.org][calluses]] on their upper [[file:2020112308-extremities.org][extremities]] as well as on their feet. Today most of us earn a [[file:2020112308-livelihood.org][livelihood]] in more [[file:2020112308-sedentary.org][sedentary]] occupations, and so we may develop calluses on less visible portions of our anatomy.
- [[file:2020112308-chiropractors.org][Chiropractors]] heal with their hands-the specialty is chiropractic (ki'-ro-PRAK'-tik).
- ~Cheir~ ( chiro-), hand, is the root in [[file:2020112308-chirography.org][chirography]] (ki-ROG'-ra- fee). Recalling the graph- in graphologist, can you figure out by etymology what chirography i s ? · _ - - - - - - - - - - -
- An expert in writing by hand, or in [[file:2020112308-penmanship.org][penmanship]] (a lost art in these days of electronic word-processing),would be a chirographer (ki-ROG'-ra-far); the adjective is chirographic
- If the suffix ~-mancy~ comes from a Greek word meaning ~fore-~ telling or prediction, can you decide what [[file:2020112309-chiromancy.org][chiromancy]] (KI'-ro- man'-see) must b e ? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

** SESSION 10
*** ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS
**** writing and writers
- The Greek verb ~graphein~, to write, is the source of a great many English words.
- We know that the [[file:2020112217-graphologist.org][graphologist]] analyzes handwriting, the term combining ~graphein~ with ~logos~, science, study. The specialty is graphology (gr:i-FOL'-:i-jee), the adjective graphological (graf'-:i- LOJ' -:i-k:il) .
- [[file:2020112317-chirographer.org][Chirographer]] is built on ~graphein~ plus ~cheir~ (chiro-), hand.
- Though [[file:2020112308-chirography.org][chirography]] may be a lost art, [[file:2020112407-calligraphy.org][calligraphy]] (ka-LIG'-rn- fee) is enjoying a revival. For centuries before the [[file:2020112407-advent.org][advent]] of printing, calligraphy, or [[file:2020112308-penmanship.org][penmanship]] as an artistic expression, was practiced by monks.
- A [[file:2020112407-calligrapher.org][calligrapher]] (ka-LIG'-ra-far) is called upon to design and write announcements, place cards, etc., as a touch of elegance. The adjective is calligraphic (kal'-a-GRAF'-ik). Calligraphy combines ~graphein~ with Greek ~kallos~, beauty, and so, by etymology, means beautiful writing.
- If a word exists for artistic handwriting, there must be one for the opposite--bad, scrawly, or illegible handwriting. And [[file:2020112407-indeed.org][indeed]] there is --- ~cacography~ (ka-KOG'-rn-fee), combining graphein with Greek ~kakos~, bad, [[file:2020112407-harsh.org][harsh]].
- By [[file:2020112407-analogy.org][analogy]] with the forms of calligraphy, can you write the word for:

- One who uses bad or illegible handwriting?
- [[file:2020112407-pertaining.org][Pertaining]] to, or marked by, bad handwriting (adjective)?

- Graphein is found in other English words:
- [[file:2020112407-cardiograph.org][cardiograph]] (discussed in Chapter 4 )-etymologically a "heart writer" (kardia, heart).
- photograph-etymologically, "written by light" (Greek ~photos~, light).
- phonograph-etymologically, a "sound writer" (Greek ~phone~, sound).
- telegraph-etymologically a "distance writer" (Greek ~tele-~, distance).
- biography-etymologically "life writing" (Greek, ~bios~, life). (Many of these new.roots will be discussed in greater detail in later chapters.)
#+begin_quote
An entrancing word that also derives from kallos is [[file:2020112407-callipygian.org][callipygian]] (kal'-:> PJJ'-ee-:m), an adjective describing a shapely or attractive rear end, or a person so endowed-the combining root is ~pyge~, [[file:2020112407-buttocks.org][buttocks]].
#+end_quote
**** aging and the old - We know that a [[file:2020112407-geriatrician.org][geriatrician]] specializes in the medical care of the elderly. The Greek word ~geras~, old age, has a derived form ~ogy~ (jair'-:m-TOL'-Q-jee), the adjective is [[file:2020112407-gerontological.org][gerontological]] (jair'- :m-t:i-LOJ'-a-hl). ~geron~, old man, the root in [[file:2020112217-gerontologist.org][gerontologist]]. The [[file:2020112407-specialty.org][specialty]] is [[file:2020112407-gerontology.org][gerontology]] (jair'-:m-TOL'-Q-jee), the adjective is gerontological (jair'- :m-t:i-LOJ'-a-hl). - The Latin word for old is ~senex~, the base on which senile, senescent, [[file:2020112407-senior.org][senior]], and [[file:2020112407-senate.org][senate]] are built. 1. [[file:2020112408-senile.org][senile]] (SEE'-nil)-showing signs of the physical and/or mental [[file:2020112408-deterioration.org][deterioration]] that generally marks very old age. The noun is [[file:2020112408-senility.org][senility]] ( SQ-NJL'-Q-tee). 2. [[file:2020112408-senescent.org][senescent]] (sQ-NES'-:mt)-aging, growing old. (Note the same suffix in this word as in [[file:2020112408-adolescent.org][adolescent]], growing into an adult, [[file:2020112408-convalescent.org][convalescent]], growing healthy again, and [[file:2020112408-obsolescent.org][obsolescent]], growing or becoming [[file:2020112408-obsolete.org][obsolete]].) The noun is senescence ( s:i-NES' -ans) . 3. [[file:2020112407-senior.org][senior]] (SEEN'-y:ir)-older. Noun: seniority (seen-YA WR'- Q-tee). 4. senate (SEN'-:it)-originally a council of older, and presumably [[file:2020112408-wiser.org][wiser]], citizens.

*** BECOMING WORD-CONSCIOUS
- Perhaps, if you have been working as [[file:2020112408-assiduously.org][assiduously]] with this book as I have repeatedly [[file:2020112408-counseled.org][counseled]], you have noticed an interesting [[file:2020112408-phenomenon.org][phenomenon]].
- This phenomenon is as follows: You read a magazine article and suddenly you see one or more of the words you have recently learned. Or you open a book and there again are some of the words you have been working with. In short, all your reading seems to call to your attention the very words you've been study ing ..
- Why? Have I, with [[file:2020112408-uncanny.org][uncanny]] foresight, picked words which have
- suddenly and [[file:2020112408-inexplicably.org][inexplicably]] become popular among writers? Obviously, that's nonsense.
- The change is in you. You have now begun to be alert to words, you have developed what is known in psychology as a "mind-set" toward certain words. Therefore, whenever these words occur in your reading you take special notice of them.
- The same words occurred before-and just as plentifully-but since they presented little communication to you, you reacted to them with an unseeing eye, with an ungrasping mind. You were [[file:2020112110-figuratively.org][figuratively]], and almost [[file:2020112408-literally.org][literally]], [[file:2020112408-blind.org][blind]] to them.
- Do you remember when you bought, or contemplated buying, a new car? Let's say it was a Toyota. Suddenly you began to see Toyotas all around you-you had a Toyota "mind-set"
- It is thus with anything new in your life. Development of a "mind-set" means that the new experience has become very real, very important, almost vital.
- If you have become suddenly [[file:2020112408-alert.org][alert]] to the new words you have been learning, you're well along toward your goal of building a superior vocabulary. You are beginning to live in a new and different [[file:2020112408-intellectual.org][intellectual]] atmosphere-nothing less!
- On the other hand, if the phenomenon I have been describing has not yet occurred, do not despair. It will. I am alerting you to its possibilities-recognize it and welcome it when it happens.

CLOCK: [2020-11-24 二 08:57]--[2020-11-24 二 15:48] =>  6:51
:END:
*** PREFACE
- If you think that grammar is an [[file:2020112411-exact.org][exact]] science, get ready for a shock. Grammar is a science, all right-but it is most [[file:2020112409-inexact.org][inexact]]. There are no [[file:2020112408-inflexible.org][inflexible]] laws, no absolutely hard and fast rules, no unchanging principles. Correctness varies with the times and depends much more on geography, on social class, and on collective human [[file:2020112408-caprice.org][caprice]] than on the restrictions found in textbooks.
- In mathematics, which is an exact science, five and five make ten the country over-in the North, in the South, in the West; in Los Angeles and Coral Gables and New York. There are no two opinions on the matter we are dealing, so far as we know, with a universal and indisputable fact.
- In grammar, however, since the facts are highly [[file:2020112219-susceptible.org][susceptible]] to change, we have to keep an eye [[file:2020112408-peeled.org][peeled]] for [[file:2020112409-trends.org][trends]]. What are educated people saying these days? Which expressions are generally used and accepted on educated levels, which others are more or less restricted to the less educated levels of speech? The answers to these questions [[file:2020112219-indicate.org][indicate]] the trend of usage in the United States, and if such trends come in conflict with academic rules, then the rules are no longer of any great importance. 
- Grammar follows the speech habits of the majority of educated people-not the other way around. That is the important point to keep in mind.
- The following notes on current trends in modern usage are intended to help you come to a decision about certain controversial expressions. As you read each sentence, pay particular attention to the [[file:2020112409-italicized.org][italicized]] word or words. Does the usage square with your own language [[file:2020112409-patterns.org][patterns]]? Would you be willing to [[file:2020112409-phrase.org][phrase]] your thoughts in just such terms? Decide whether the sentence is right or wrong, then compare your conclusion with the opinions given following the test.
*** Examples
**** Let's keep this between you and I.
- WRONG. Children are so frequently corrected by piirents and teachers when they say me that they cannot be blamed if they begin to think that this simple syllable is probably a naughty word. Dialogues such as the following are certainly typical of many households.
- "Mother, can me and Johnnie go out and play?"
- "No, dear, not until you say it correctly. You mean 'May John-
- nie and I go out to play?' "
- "Who wants a jelly apple?"
- "Me!"
- "Then use the proper word."
- (The child becomes a little confused at this point-there seem
- to be so many "ptoper" and "improper" words.)
- "Me, please!"
- "No, dear, not me."
- "Oh. I, please?"
- (This sounds terrible to a child's ear. It completely violates his sense of language, but he does want the jelly apple, so he grudgingly conforms.)
- "Who broke my best [[file:2020112411-vase.org][vase]]?"
- "It wasn't me!"
- "Is that good English, Johnnie?"
- "Okay, it wasn't I. But honest, Mom, it wasn't me-I didn't even touch it!"
- And so, if the child is strong enough to survive such constant corrections, he decides that whenever there is room for doubt, it is safer to say I. Some adults, conditioned in childhood by the kind of misguided censorship detailed here, are likely to believe that "between you and I" is the more elegant form of expression, but most educated
- speakers, obeying the rule that a preposition
**** I'm your best friend, ain't I?
- WRONG. As linguistic scholars have frequently pointed out, it is unfortunate that ain't I? is unpopular in educated speech, for the phrase fills a long-felt need. Am I not? is too [[file:2020112411-prissy.org][prissy]] for down-to-earth people; amn't I? is ridiculous; and aren't I, though popular in England, has never really caught on in America. With a sentence like the one under discussion you are practically in a linguistic trap-there is no way out unless you are willing to choose between appearing illiterate, sounding prissy, or feeling ridiculous.
- "What is the matter with ain't I? for am I not?" language scholar Wallace Rice once wrote. "Nothing whatever, save that a number of minor grammarians object to it. Ain't I? has a pleasant sound once the ears are unstopped of prejudice." Mr. Rice has a valid point there, ·yet educated people avoid ain't I? as if it were catching. In all honesty, therefore, I must say to you: don't use ain't I?, except humorously. What is a safe substitute? Apparently none exists, so I suggest that you manage, by some linguistic [[file:2020112411-calisthenics.org][calisthenics]], to avoid having to make a choice. Otherwise you may find yourself in the position of being damned if you do and damned if you don't.

**** Five and five is ten.
RIGHT. But don't jump to the conclusion that "five and five are ten" is wrong-both verbs are equaliy acceptable in this or any similar construction. If you prefer to think of "five-and-five" as a single mathematical concept, say is. If you find it more reasonable to consider "five and five" a plural idea, say are. The teachers I've polled on this point are about evenly divided in preference, and so, I imagine, are the rest of us. Use whichever verb has the greater appeal to your sense of logic.

**** I never saw a man get so mad.
- RIGHT. When I questioned a number of authors and editors about their opinion of the acceptability of mad as a synonym for angry, the typical reaction was: "Yes, I say mad, but I always feel a little guilty when I do."
- Most people do say mad when they are sure there is no English teacher listening; it's a good sharp word, everybody understands exactly what it means, and it's a lot stronger than angry, though not quite as violent as furious or enraged. In short, mad has a special implication offered by no other word in the English language; as a consequence, educated people use it as the occasion [[file:2020112411-demands.org][demands]] and it is perfectly correct. So correct, in fact, that every authoritative dictionary lists it as a completely acceptable usage. If you feel guilty when you say mad, even though you don't mean insane, it's time you stopped [[file:2020112411-plaguing.org][plaguing]] your conscience with trivialities.
**** Every one of his sisters are unmarried.
- WRONG. Are is perhaps the more logical word, since the sentence implies that he has more than one sister and they are alI unmarried. In educated speech, however, the tendency is to make the verb agree with the subject, even if logic is violated in the process-and the better choice here would. be is, agreeing with the singular subject, every one.
**** He visited an optometrist for an eye operation.
- WRONG. If the gentleman in question did indeed need an operation, he went to the wrong doctor. In most states, optometrists are forbidden by law to perform surgery or administer drugs- they may only prescribe and fit glasses. And they are not medical doctors. The M.D. who specializes in the treatment of eye diseases, and who may operate when necessary, is an [[file:2020112209-ophthalmologist.org][ophthalmologist]]. (See· Chapter 4.)
**** Do you [[file:2020112411-prophecy.org][prophecy]] another world war?
WRONG. Use prophecy only when you mean prediction, a noun. When you mean predict, a verb, as in this sentence, use [[file:2020112411-prophesy.org][prophesy]]. This distinction is simple and foolproof. Therefore we properly say: "His ·prophecy (prediction) turned out to be true," but "He really seems able to prophesy (predict) political trends." There is a distinction also in the pronunciation of these two words. Prophecy is pronounced PROF'-a-see; prophesy is pronunced PROF'- a-si'.
**** Leave us not mention it.
WRONG. On the less sophisticated levels of American speech, leave is a popular substitute for let. On educated levels, the following distinction is carefully observed: let means allow; leave means [[file:2020112413-depart.org][depart]]. (There are a few [[file:2020112413-idiomatic.org][idiomatic]] exceptions to this rule, · but they present no problem.) "Let me go" is preferable to "Leave me go" even on the most informal of occasions, and a sentence like "Leave us not mention it" is not considered standard English.
**** If you expect to eventually succeed, you must keep trying.
- RIGHT. We have here, in case you're [[file:2020112413-puzzled.org][puzzled]], an example of that [[file:2020112317-notorious.org][notorious]] bugbear of academic grammar, the "split infinitive." (An infinitive is a verb preceded by to: to succeed, to fail, to remember.)  
- Splitting an [[file:2020112413-infinitive.org][infinitive]] is not at all difficult-you need only insert a word between the to and the verb: to eventually succeed, to completely fail, to quickly remember.
- Now that you know how to split an infinitive, the important question is, is it legal to do so? I am happy to be able to report to you that it is not only legal, it is also [[file:2020112413-ethical.org][ethical]], [[file:2020112413-moral.org][moral]], and sometimes more effective than to not split it. Benjamin Franklin, Washington Irving, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Theodore Roosevelt, and Woodrow Wilson, among many others, were [[file:2020112406-unconscionable.org][unconscionable]] infinitive splitters. And modem writers are equaliy partial to the construction.
- To bring this report up to the minute, I asked a number of editors about their attitude toward the split infinitive. Here are two typical reactions.
- An editor at Doubleday and Company: "The restriction against the split infinitive is, to my mind, the most artificial of all [[file:2020112413-grammatical.org][grammatical]] rules. I find that most educated people split infinitives reg ularly in their speech, and only eliminate them from their writing when they rewrite and polish their material."
- An editor at Reader's [[file:2020112413-digest.org][Digest]]: "I want to defend the split infinitive. The construction adds to the strength of the sentence-it's compact and clear. This is to loudly say that I split an infinitive whenever I can catch one."
- And here, finally, is the opinion of humorist James Thurber, as quoted by Rudolf Flesch in The Art of Plain Talk: "Word has somehow got around that the split infinitive is always wrong. This is of a piece with the [[file:2020112413-outworn.org][outworn]] notion that it is always wrong to [[file:2020112413-strike.org][strike]] a lady.
- I think the evidence is conclusive enough-it is perfectly correct to consciously split an infinitive whenever such an act increases the strength or clarity of your sentence. 
* HOW TO TALK ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENTISTS
** SESSION 11
- A true scientist lives up to the etymological meaning of his title "one who knows." Anything scientific is based on facts-observable facts that can be recorded, tested, checked, and verified.
- Science, then, deals with human knowledge-as far as it has gone. It has gone very far indeed since the last century or two, when we stopped basing our thinking on guesses, wishes, theories that had no foundation in reality, and concepts of how the world ought to be; and instead began to explore the world as it was, and not only the world but the whole universe. From Galileo, who looked through the first telescope atop a tower in Pisa, Italy, through Pasteur, who watched microbes through a microscope, to Einstein, who deciphered [[file:2020112414-riddles.org][riddles]] of the universe by means of mathematics, we have at last begun to fill in a few areas of ignorance.
- Who are some of the more important explorers of knowl- edge-and by what terms are they known?

*** ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS
**** people and the stars
- Anthropologist is constructed from roots we are familiar with- ~anthropos~, mankind, and ~logos~, science, study.
- The science is [[file:2020112110-anthropology.org][anthropology]] ( an'-thra~POL'-;;i-jee). Can you write the adjective form of this word? - - - - - - - - - (Can you pronounce it?)
- [[file:2020112415-astronomer.org][Astronomer]] is built on Greek ~astron~, star, and nomos, arrange ment, law, or order. The astronomer is interested in the arrange-ment of stars and other [[file:2020112415-celestial.org][celestial]] bodies. The science is. astronomy (Q-SlRON'-~mee), the adjective is astronomical(as'-trn- NOM'-Q-kQl), a word often used in a non-heavenly sense, as in "the astronomical size of the national debt." Astronomy deals in such enormous distances (the sun, for example, is 93,000,000 miles from the earth, and light from stars travels toward the earth at 186,000 miles per second) that the adjective astronomical is applied to any tremendoµsly large figure.
- ~Astron~, star, combines with ~logos~ to ~fonn~ astrology (Q-STROL'- ~jee), which [[file:2020112415-assesses.org][assesses]] the influence of planets and stars on human events. The practitioner is an astrologer (Q-SlROL'-Q-jQr). Can you form the adjective? . (Can you pronounce it?)
- By etymology, an astronaut (AS'-trQ-not') is a sailor among the stars (Greek nautes, sailor). This person is termed with some- what less [[file:2020112406-exaggeration.org][exaggeration]] a [[file:2020112415-cosmonaut.org][cosmonaut]] (KOZ'-m~not') by the Russians (Greek, kosmos, universe). Nautical (NOT'-a-kQl), relating to sailors, sailing, ships, or navigation, derives also from [[file:2020112415-nautes.org][nautes]], and nautes in tum is from Greek naus, ship-a root used in nau- sea (etymologically, ship-sickness or seasickness!). (etymologically, ship-sickness or seasickness!).
- Aster (AS'-tQr) is a star shaped flower. Asterisk (AS'-tQ-risk), a star-shaped symbol (*), is generally used in writing or printing to direct the reader to look for a footnote. Astrophysics (as'-~ FIZ' -iks) is that branch of physics dealing with heavenly bodies.
- Disaster (d~ZAS'-tQr) and disastrous (dQ-ZA$'-trns) also come from ~astron~, star. In ancient times it was believed that the stars ruled human destiny; any misfortune or [[file:2020112415-calamity.org][calamity]], therefore, happened to someone because the stars were in opposition. (Dis-, a prefix of many meanings, in this word signifies against.) ·
- ~Nomos~, [[file:2020112415-arrangement.org][arrangement]], ~law~, or ~order~, is found in two other interesting English words.
- For example, if you can make your own laws for yourself, if you needn't answer to anyone else for what you do, in short, if you are independent, then you enjoy [[file:2020112415-autonomy.org][autonomy]] (aw-TON'-a- mee), a word that combines ~nomos~, ~law~, with ~autos~, self. Autonomy, then, is self-law, self-government. The fifty states in our nation are [[file:2020112415-fairly.org][fairly]] [[file:2020112415-autonomous.org][autonomous]] (aw-TO'N''~mQs), but not completely so. On the other hand, ·in most colleges each separate department is pretty much autonomous. And of course, one of the big reasons for the revolution of 1776 was that America wanted autonomy, rather than control by England.
- You know the instrument that beginners at the piano use to guide their timing? A pendulum swings back and forth, making an audible click at each swing, and in that way governs or orders the measure (or timing) of the player. Hence it is called a metronome (MET' -n~-nom'), a word that combines nomos with metron, measurement.
**** the earth and its life
- [[file:2020112415-geologist.org][Geologist]] derives from Greek ~ge~ (geo-), earth. The science is geology (jee-OL'-a-jee). Can you write the adjective? (Can you pronounce it?)
- Geometry (jee-OM'-a-tree)__:_ge plus ~metron~-by etymology "measurement of the earth," is that branch of [[file:2020112415-mathematics.org][mathematics]] treating of the measurement and properties of solid and plane figures, such as angles, triangles, squares, spheres, [[file:2020112415-prisms.org][prisms]], etc. (The ety-
- mology of the word shows that this ancient science was originally concerned with the measurement of land and spaces on the earth.)
- The [[file:2020112415-mathematician.org][mathematician]] is a [[file:2020112415-geometrician.org][geometrician]] (jee'-a-ma•TRISH'-an), the adjective is geometric (jee'-a-MET'-rik).
- Geography (jee-OG'-ra-fee) is writing about (graphein, to write), or mapping, the earth. A practitioner of the science is a ge- ographer (Jee-OG'-ra-far), the adjective is geographic (jee-a- GRAF'-ik).
- (The name George iS also derived from ge (geo-), earth, plus ~ergon~, ~work~-the first George was an earth-worker or farmer.).
- Biologist combines ~bios~, life, with ~logos~, science, study. The science is biology (bi-OL'-a-jee). The adjective?-------
-  ~Bios~, life, is also found in biography (bi-OG'-ra-fee), writing about someone's. life; autobiography (aw'-ta-bi-OG'-ra-fee), the story of one's life written by oneself; and biopsy (Bi'-op-see), a
- medical examination, or view (~opsis~, ~optikos~, view, vision), generally through a microscope, of living tissue, frequently performed when cancer is suspected. A small part of the tissue is cut from the affected area and under the microscope its cells can be investigated for evidence of [[file:2020112415-malignancy.org][malignancy]]. A [[file:2020112415-biopsy.org][biopsy]] is contrasted with an autopsy (AW'-top-see), which is a medical examination of a [[file:2020112415-corpse.org][corpse]] in order to discover the cause of death. Th autos in autopsy means, as you know, self-in an autopsy, etymologically speaking, the surgeon or pathologist determines, by actual view or sight rather than by theorizing (i.e., "by viewing or seeing for - oneself'), what brought the corpse to its present grievous state.
- [[file:2020112415-botanist.org][Botanist]] is from Greek ~botane~, plant. The field is botany (BOT'-:i-nee); the adjective is botanical (b:i-TAN'-a-kal).
- [[file:2020112417-zoologist.org][Zoologist]] is from Greek ~zoion~, animal. The science is [[file:2020112417-zoology.org][zoology]].
- The adjective? . The combination of the two ostempts many people to pronounce the first three letters of these words in one syllable, thus: zoo. However, the two o's should be separated, as in co-operate, even though no hyphen is used in the spelling to indicate such separation. Say z0- 0L'-a-jist, z0-0L'-a-jee, zo'-a-LOJ'-a-kal. Zoo, a park for animals, is a shortened form of zoological gardens, and is, of course,
pronounced in one syllable.
- The [[file:2020112415-zodiac.org][zodiac]] (Z6'-dee-ak) is a diagram, used in astrology, of the paths of the sun, moon, and planets; it contains, in part, Latin names for various animals---scorpio, [[file:2020112415-scorpion.org][scorpion]]; ~leo~, lion; ~cancer~, [[file:2020112417-crab.org][crab]]; ~taurus~, [[file:2020112417-bull.org][bull]]; aries, [[file:2020112417-ram.org][ram]]; and [[file:2020112415-pisces.org][pisces]], fish. ~Hence~ its derivation from ~zoion~, animal.
- The adjective is [[file:2020112417-zodiacal.org][zodiacal]] (zO-Dl'-a-kal).
