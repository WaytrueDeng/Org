*** SESSION 3
**** Origin and relative words
***** depends how you turn
- √verto to turn
- the prefix ambi- also found in [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112110-ambidexterity.org][ambidexterity]]
  - [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112110-dexterous.org][dexterous]] means skillful, the noun [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112110-dexterity.org][dexterity]] is skill.
  - [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112110-dexter.org][dexter]] is a latin word for right hand, in the [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112110-ambidextrous.org][ambidextrous]] person both hands are right hands.
  - [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112110-left_handed.org][left-handed]] is still the synonym of awkward
  - the Latin word for the left hand is [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112110-sinister.org][sinister]]
  - The French word for the left hand is [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112110-gauche.org][gauche]]. A [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112110-gauche.org][gauche]] remark is [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112110-tactless.org][tactless]]. A [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112110-gauche.org][gauche]] offer of a sympathy is so [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112020-bumbling.org][bumbling]] to be embarassing. [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112110-gaucherie.org][gaucherie]] is an awkward, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112110-clumsy.org][clumsy]], [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112110-tactless.org][tactless]], embarrassing way of saying things or of handling situation. The [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112110-gauche.org][gauche]] person is totally without [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112110-finesse.org][finesse]].
  - And the French word for the right hand is [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112110-droit.org][droit]], which we have used in building our English word adroit ( a-DROYT'). Needless to say, adroit, like dexterous, means skillful, but especially in the exercise of the mental [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112110-facilities.org][facilities]]. Like gauche, adroit, or its [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112110-nounadroitness.org][nounadroitness]], usually is used [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112110-figuratively.org][figuratively]]. The adroit person is quick-witted, can get out of difficult spots cleverly, can handle situations [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112110-ingeniously.org][ingeniously]]. Adroitness is, then, quite the opposite of gaucherie.
***** love,hate,and marriage
****** √misein to hate
Misanthrope, misogynist, and misogamist are built on the Greek root ~misein~, to hate. The misanthrope hates mankind (Greek ~anthropos~, mankind); the misogynist hates women (Greek ~gyne~, woman); the misogamist hates marriage (Greek ~gamos~, marriage). Anthropos, mankind, is also found in [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112110-anthropology.org][anthropology]] (an-thra-POL'-a-jee), the study of the development of the human race; and in [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112110-philanthropist.org][philanthropist]] (fa-LAN'-thra-pist), one who loves man-kind and shows such love by making [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112110-substantial.org][substantial]] financial contributions to charitable organizations or by donating time and energy to helping those in need. The root gyne, woman, is also found in [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112110-gynecologist.org][gynecologist]]  jin· -KOL'-a-jist, the medical specialis treats female disorders. And the root gamos, marriage, occurs also in [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112110-monogamy.org][monogamy]] (rna-NOG'-a-mee), [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112110-bigamy.org][bigamy]] (BIG'-a-rnee), and [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112110-polygamy.org][polygamy]] (pa-LIG'-a-mee). (As we will discover later, monos means one, bi- means two, polys means many.)
So monogamy is the custom of only one marriage (at a time).
Bigamy, by etymology, is two marriages-in actuality, the unlawful act of contracting another marriage without divorcing one's current legal spouse.
And polygamy, by derivation many marriages, and therefore etymologically [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112111-denoting.org][denoting]] [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112111-plural.org][plural]] marriage for either males or females, in current usage generally refers to the custom practiced in earlier times by the [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112111-mormons.org][Mormons]], and before them by King Solomon, in which the man has as many wives as he can afford financially and/or emotionally. The correct, but rarely used, term for this custom is polygyny (p;;i-LIJ'-a-nee)-polys, many, plus gyne,woman.
What if a woman has two or more husbands, a form of marriage practiced in the Himalaya Mountains of Tibet? That custom is called [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112111-polyandry.org][polyandry]] (pol-ee-AN'-dree), from polys plus Greek
~andros~, male.
***** making friends with suffixes
***** living alone and liking it √asketes
[[file:./EnglishWord/2020112111-ascetic.org][Ascetic]] is from the Greek word ~asketes~, monk or hermit.
A monk lives a lonely life-not for him the pleasures of the fleshpots, the [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112111-laughter.org][laughter]] and [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112111-merriment.org][merriment]] of [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112111-convivial.org][convivial]] gatherings, the [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112111-dissipation.org][dissipation]] of high living. Rather, days of contemplation, study, and rough [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112111-toil.org][toil]], nights on a hard bed in a simple cell, and the kind of self-denial that leads to a [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112111-purification.org][purification]] of the soul.
That person is an ascetic who leads an existence, voluntarily of course, that compares in [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112111-austerity.org][austerity]], simplicity, and [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112111-rigorous.org][rigorous]] hardship with the life of a monk.
The practice is [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112111-asceticism.org][asceticism]] (a-SET'-;l-siz-am), the adjective ascetic.

*** ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS
**** inside you
Internist and internal derive from the same Latin root, ~internus~, inside. The internist is a specialist in internal medicine, in the exploration of your insides. This physician determines the state of your internal organs in order to discover what's happening within your body to cause the troubles you're complaining of. Do not confuse the internist with the [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-intern.org][intern]] (also spelled interne), who is a medical graduate serving an [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-apprenticeship.org][apprenticeship]] inside a hospital

**** doctors for women
The word [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112110-gynecologist.org][gynecologist]] is built on Greek ~gyne~, woman, plus ~logos~, science; etymologically, gynecology is the science (in actual use, the medical science) of women. [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-adjective.org][Adjective]]: gynecological (gin [or jin or jinJ-a-kQ-LOJ'-a-kal). [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-obstetrician.org][Obstetrician]] derives from Latin ~obstetrix~, midwife, which in turn has its source in a Latin verb meaning to stand-midwives stand in front of the woman in labor to aid in the delivery of the infant. The suffix ~-ician~, as in obstetrician, physician, musician, magi- cian, electrician, etc., means expert. Obstetrics (ob-STET'-riks) has only within the last 150 years become a respectable specialty. No further back than 1834, Professor William P. Dewees [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-assumed.org][assumed]] the first chair of obstetrics at the University of Pennsylvania and had to brave considerable medical contempt and [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-ridicule.org][ridicule]] as a result-the delivery of children was then considered beneath the [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112108-dignity.org][dignity]] of the medical profession. Adjective: obstetric (ob-STET'-rik) or obstetrical (ob-STET'- ra-kal).

**** children
Pediatrician is a combination of Greek ~paidos~, child; ~iatreia~, medical healing; and -ician, expert. · Pediatrics (pee-dee-AT'-riks), then, is by etymology the medical healing of a child. Adjective: pediatric (pee-dee-AT'-rik). (The ped- you see in words like [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-pedestal.org][pedestal]], [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-pedal.org][pedal]], and [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-pedestrian.org][pedestrian]] is from the Latin ~pedis~, foot, and [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-despite.org][despite]] the identical spelling in English has no relationship to Greek ~paidos~.) [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-pedagogy.org][Pedagogy]] (PED-a-go'-jee), which combines ~paidos~ with ~agogos~, leading; is, etymologically, the leading of children. And to what do you lead them? To learning, to development, to growth, to maturity. From the moment of birth, infants are led by adults- they are taught, first by parents and then by teachers, to be self-sufficient, to *fit into* the culture in which they are born. Hence, pedagogy, which by derivation means the leading of a child, refers actually to the principles and methods of teaching. College students majoring in education take certain standard pedagogy courses-the history of education; educational psychology; the psychology of [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-adolescents.org][adolescents]]; principles of teaching; etc. Adjective: pedagogical (ped-a-GOJ'-a-kal). A pedagogue (PED'-:i-gog) is versed in pedagogy. But [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-pedagogue.org][pedagogue]] has an unhappy history. From its original, neutral meaning of teacher, it has deteriorated to the point where it refers, today, to *a* *narrow-minded*,[[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-strait_laced.org][strait-laced]] ,old-fashioned, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-dogmatic.org][dogmatic]] teacher. It is a word of contempt and should be used with caution. Like. pedagogue, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-demagogue.org][demagogue]] (DEM'-a-gog) has also deteriorated in meaning. By derivation a leader (agogos) of the people (~demos~), a demagogue today is actually one who attempts, in [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-essence.org][essence]], to mislead the people, a politician who foments discontent among the masses, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-rousing.org][rousing]] them to fever [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-pitch.org][pitch]] by wild [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-oratory.org][oratory]], in an attempt to be voted into office. Once elected, demagogues use political power to further their
own personal ambitions or fortunes. Many "leaders" of the past and present, in countries around the world, have been [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-accused.org][accused]] of demagoguery ( dem-a-(]OG' -a-ree) . Adjective: demagogic (dem-a-GOJ'-ik).
**** skin-deep
The [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112209-dermatologist.org][dermatologist]], whose specialty is dermatology ( dur-ma- TOL'-a-jee), is so named from Greek ~derma~, skin. Adjective: dermatological ( dur'-ma-ta-LOJ'-a-kal). See the syllables derma in any English word and you will know there is some reference to skin-for example, a [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-hypodermic.org][hypodermic]] . (hi~ pa-DUR'..,mik) needle [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-penetrates.org][penetrates]] under (Greek, ~hypos~) the skin,· the [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-epidermis.org][epidermis]] (ep-:i-DUR'-mis) ·is the outermost layer of skin; a [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-taxidermist.org][taxidermist]] (TAKS'-a-dur-mist), whose business is [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-taxidermy.org][taxidermy]] (TAKS'-a-dur-mee), prepares, stuffs, and mounts the skins of animals; a [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-pachyderm.org][pachyderm]] (PAK'-a-durm) is an animal with an unusually [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-thick.org][thick]] skin, like an elephant, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-hippopotamus.org][hippopotamus]], or [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-rhinoceros.org][rhinoceros]]; and [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-dermatitis.org][dermatitis]] (dur-ma-Ti'-tis) is the general name for any skin inflammation, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-irritation.org][irritation]], or infection.
**** the eyes have it
Ophthalmologist-note the ph preceding th-is from Greek ~ophthalmos~, eye, plus ~·logos~, science or study. The specialty is ophthalmology (off'-thal-MOU-a-jee), the adjective ophthal-mological ( off'-thal-ma-LOJ'-a-kal). An earlier title for this physician, still occasionally used, is ocu- list (OK'-ya-list), from Latin [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-oculus.org][oculus]], eye, a root on which the following English words are also built:
1. [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-ocular.org][ocular]] (OK'-ya-Iar)-an adjective that refers to the eye
2. [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-monocle.org][monocle]] (MON'-a-kal)-a lens for one (monos) eye, sported by characters in old movies as a symbol of the British so-called upper class
3. [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-binoculars.org][binoculars]] (ba-NOK'-ya-larz)-field glasses that increase the range of two (bi-) eyes
4. And, strangely enough, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-inoculate.org][inoculate]] (in-OK'-ya-layt'), a word commonly [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-misspelled.org][misspelled]] with two n's. When you are inoculated against a disease, an "eye," [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-puncture.org][puncture]], or hole is made in your skin, through which [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-serum.org][serum]] is injected. Do not confuse the ophthalmologist or oculist, a medical specialist, with two other [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-practitioners.org][practitioners]] who deal with the eye-the [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-optometrist.org][optometrist]] (op-TOM'-a-trist) and [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-optician.org][optician]] (op-TISH'-an). Optometrists are not [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-physicians.org][physicians]], and do not perform surgery or administer drugs; they measure vision, test for [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112209-glaucoma.org][glaucoma]], and prescribe and fit glasses. Opticians fill an optometrist's or ophthalmologist's prescription, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112211-grinding.org][grinding]] lenses according to specifications; they do not [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112211-examine.org][examine]] patients. Optometrist combines Greek ~opsis~, ~optikos~, sight or vision, with ~metron~, measurement .the optometrist, by etyi:pology, is one who measures vision. The specialty is [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112211-optometry.org][optometry]] (op-TOM'-a-tree).
Optician is built on opsis, optikos, plus -ician, expert. The specialty is optics (OP'-tiks). Adjectives: optometric ( op-ta-MET'-rik) or optometrical (op- ta-MET'-ra-kal), optical (OP'-ta-kal).

**** ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS
***** the straighteners
The [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112209-orthopedist.org][orthopedist]] is so called from the Greek roots ~orthos~, straight or correct, and ~paidos~, child. The orthopedist, by etymology, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112215-straightens.org][straightens]] children. The term was [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112215-coined.org][coined]] in 1741 by the author of a textbook on the [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112215-prevention.org][prevention]] of childhood diseases-at that time the correction of spinal [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112209-curvature.org][curvature]] in children was a main concern of practitioners of orthopedics ( awr-tha-PEE' -diks). Today the specialty treats [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112215-deformities.org][deformities]], [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112215-injuries.org][injuries]], and diseases of the bones and joints (of adults as well as children, of course), often by surgical procedures. Adjective: orthopedic (awr-tha-PEE'-dik). [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112215-orthodontia.org][Orthodontia]] (awr-tha-DON'-sha), the straightening of teeth, is built on ~orthos~ plus ~odontos~, tooth. The [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112215-orthodontist.org][orthodontist]] (aWl'-tha- DON'-tist) specializes in improving your "bite," retracting "[[file:./EnglishWord/2020112215-buck_teeth.org][buck teeth]]," and by means of braces and other techniques seeing to it
that every [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112215-molar.org][molar]], [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112215-incisor.org][incisor]], [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112215-bicuspid.org][bicuspid]], etc. is exactly where it belongs in your mouth.
Adjective: orthodontic (awr-tha-DON'-tik).
***** the heart
[[file:./EnglishWord/2020112215-cardiologist.org][Cardiologist]] combines Greek ~kardia~, heart, and ~logos~, science.
The specialty is cardiology (kahr-dee-OL'-a-jee), the adjective cardiological (kahr'-dee-a-LOJ'-a-kal).
So a cardiac (KAHR'-dee-ak) condition refers to some malfunctioning of the heart; a cardiogram (KAHR'-dee-a-gram') is an electrically produced record of the heartbeat. The instrument that produces this record is called a cardiograph (KAHR'-dee-a- graf').
***** the nervous system
Neurologist derives from Greek ~neuron~, nerve, plus logos, sci-
ence.
Specialty: neurology (noor-OL'-a-jee); adjective: neurological
(noor-a-LOJ'-a-kal).
[[file:./EnglishWord/2020112215-neuralgia.org][Neuralgia]] (noor-AL'-ja) is acute pain along the nerves and
their branches; the word comes from neuron plus ~algos~, pain.
[[file:./EnglishWord/2020112215-neuritis.org][Neuritis]] (noor-1'-tis), is [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112215-inflammation.org][inflammation]] of the nerves.
[[file:./EnglishWord/2020112215-neurosis.org][Neurosis]] (noor-0'-sis), combining neuron with ~-osis~, a ~suffix~ meaning abnormal or diseased condition, is not, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-despite.org][despite]] its etymology, a disorder of the nerves, but rather, as· described by the late Eric Berne, a psychiatrist, "... an illness characterized by excessive use of energy for unproductive purposes so that personality development is [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112215-hindered.org][hindered]] or stopped. A man who spends most of his time worrying about his health, counting his money, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112215-plotting.org][plotting]] revenge, or washing his  hands, can hope for little emotional growth." .
Neurotic (m;lOr-OT'-ik) is both the adjective form and the term
for a person suffering from neurosis.
***** the mind
A neurosis is not a form of mental unbalance. A full-blown mental disorder is called a [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112215-psychosis.org][psychosis]] (si-KO'-sis), a word built on Greek ~psyche~, spirit, soul, or mind, plus -osis. A true psychotic (si-KOT'-ik) has lost contact with reality-at least with reality as most of us [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112215-perceive.org][perceive]] it, though no doubt psychotic (note that this word, h"ke neurotic, is both a noun and an adjective) people have their own form of reality. Built on psyche plus ~iatreia~, medical healing, a psychiatrist by etymology is a mind-healer. The specialty is psychiatry (si- or sa- Kf-tree); the adjective is psychiatric (si~kee-AT'-rik).
[[file:./EnglishWord/2020112215-pediatrics.org][Pediatrics]], as you know, is also built on ~iatreia~, as is [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112215-podiatry.org][podiatry]] (p~-Df'-::>-tree), discussed, in the next chapter, and [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112215-geriatrics.org][geriatrics]]
(jair'-ee-AT'-riks), the specialty dealing with the particular medi-
cal needs of the elderly. (This word combines iatreia with. Greek
ge.ras, old age.)
The specialist is a geriatrician (jair'-ee-::>-TRISH'-~n), the ad-
jective is geriatric (jair'-ee-AT'-rik).

* Brief Intermission Two
** RANDOM NOTES ON MODERN USAGE
English grammar is confusing enough as it is-what makes it doubly confounding is that it is slowly but continually changing. •
This means that some of the strict rules you memorized so painfully in your high school or college English courses may no longer be completely valid.
Following such outmoded principles, you may think you are speaking "perfect" English, and instead you may sound [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112216-stuffy.org][stuffy]] and [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112216-pedantic.org][pedantic]].
The problem boils down to this: If grammatical usage is gradually becoming more liberal, where does educated, unaffected, informal speech end? And where does illiterate, ungrammatical speech begin?
The following notes on current trends in modem usage are intended to help you come to a decision about certain [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112216-controversial.org][controversial]] expressions. As you read each sentence, pay particular attention to the italicized word or words. Does the usage [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112216-square.org][square]] with your own language patterns? Would you be willing to phrase your thought in just terms? Decide whether the sentence is right or wrong, then compare your conclusion with the opinion given in the explanatory paragraphs that follow the test.

* HOW TO TALK ABOUT VARIOUS PRACTITIONERS
** SESSION 7
An ancient Greek [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112217-mused.org][mused]] about the meaning of life, and philosophy was born. The first Roman decided fo build a road instead of cutting a path through the jungle, and engineering came into existence. One day in [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112217-primitive.org][primitive]] times, a human being [[roam:lent]] to another whatever then passed for money and got back his original investment plus a little more-and banking had started.
Most people Spend part of every workday at some gainful employment, honest or otherwise, and in so doing often contribute their little [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112217-mite.org][mite]] to the progress of the world.
We explore in this chapter the ideas behind people's occupations-and the words that translate these ideas into verbal symbols.

** SESSION 8
*** ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS
**** the mental life
- Psychologist is built upon the same Greek root as psychiatrist-~psyche~, spirit, soul, or mind. In psychiatrist, the combining form is ~iatreia~, medical healing. In psychologist, the combining form is ~logos~, science or study; a psychologist, by etynmology, is one who studies the mind.
- The field is psychology (si-KOL'-~jee), the adjective psychological (si'-k~LOJ'-a-kal).
- [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112218-psyche.org][Psyche]] (SI'-kee) is also an English word in its own right..:._it designates the mental life, the spiritual or non-physical [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112020-aspect.org][aspect]] of one's existence. The adjective psychic (SI'-kik) refers to [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112218-phenomena.org][phenomena]] or qualities that cannot be explained in purely physical terms. People may be called psychic if they seem to possess a sixth sense, a special gift of mind reading, or any mysterious [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112217-aptitudes.org][aptitudes]] that cannot be accounted for logically. A person's [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112218-disturbance.org][disturbance]] is psychic if ii is emotional or mental, rather than physical.
- Psyche combines with the Greek ~pathos~, suffering or disease, to form [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112218-psychopathic.org][psychopathic]] (si-ka-PATH'-ik), an adjective that describes someone suffering from a severe mental or emotional disorder. The noun is psychopathy (sI'-KOP'~thee).*
- The root psyche combines with Greek ~soma~, body, to form psychosomatic (si'-ko-s::i-MAT'-ik), an adjective that [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112219-delineates.org][delineates]] the powerful influence that the mind, especially the unconscious, has on bodily diseases. Thus, a person who fears the consequence of being present at a certain meeting will suddenly develop a bad cold or backache, or even be injured in a traffic accident, so that his appearance at this meeting is made impossible. It's a real cold, it's far from [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112219-ari.org][ari]] imaginary backache, and of course one cannot in any sense doubt the reality of the automobile that injured him. Yet, according to the psychosomatic theory of medicine, his unconscious made him [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112219-susceptible.org][susceptible]] to the cold [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112219-germs.org][germs]], caused the backache, or forced him into the path of the car.
- A [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112219-psychosomatic.org][psychosomatic]] disorder actually exists [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112219-insofar.org][insofar]] as symptoms are concerned (headache, excessive urination, pains, paralysis, heart [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112219-palpitations.org][palpitations]]), yet there is no organic cause within the body. The cause is within the psyche, the mind. Dr. Flanders Dunbar, in Mind and Body, gives a clear and exciting account of the inter relationship between emotions and diseases.
- Psychoanalysis (si'-ko-a-NAL'-a-sis) relies on the [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112219-technique.org][technique]] of deeply, exhaustively [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112219-probing.org][probing]] into the unconscious, a technique developed by Sigmund Freud. In oversimplified terms, the general principle of psychoanalysis is to guide the patient to an awareness of the deep-seated, unconscious causes of anxieties, fears, conflicts, and tension. Once fourtd, exposed to the light of day, and [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112219-thoroughly.org][thoroughly]] understood, claim the psychoanalysts, these causes may [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112219-vanish.org][vanish]] like a light snow that is exposed to strong sunlight
- Consider an example: You have [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112219-asthma.org][asthma]], let us say, and your doctor can find no physical [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112219-basis.org][basis]] for your ailment. So you are referred to a psychoanalyst (or psychiatrist or clinical psychologist who practices psychoanalytically oriented therapy).
- With your therapist you explore your past life, dig into your un conscious, and discover, let us say for th~ sake of argument, that your mother or father always used to set for you impossibly high goals. No matter what you accomplished in school, it was not good enough in your mother's or father's opinion (and such opinions were always made painfully clear to you), you could do better if you were not so lazy. As a child you built up certain [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112219-resentments.org][resentments]] and anxieties because you seemed unable to please your parent-and (this will sound [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112219-farfetched.org][farfetched]], but it is perfectly possible) as a result you became asthmatic. How else were you going to get the parental love, the [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112219-approbation.org][approbation]], the attention you needed and that you felt you were not receiving?
- In your sessions with your therapist, you discover that your asthma is emotionally, rather than organically, based-your ailment is psychogenic (sI'-ko-JEN'-ik), of Psychic origin, or (the terms are used more or less interchangeably although they [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112219-differ.org][differ]] somewhat in definition) psychosomatic, resulting from the interaction of mind and body. ([[file:./EnglishWord/2020112219-psychogenic.org][Psychogenic]] is built on psyche plus Greek ~genesis~, birth or origin.)
- And your treatment? No drugs, no surgery-these may help the body, not the emotions. Instead, you "work out" (this is the term used in psychoanalytic [si-ko-an'-a-LIT'-ik] [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112219-parlance.org][parlance]]) early [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112219-trauma.org][trauma]] in talk, in remembering, in exploring, in interpreting, in reliving childhood experiences. And if your [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112219-asthma.org][asthma]] is indeed psychogenic (or psychosomatic), therapy will very likely help you; your attacks may [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112219-cease.org][cease]], either gradually or suddenly.
- [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112219-freudian.org][Freudian]] therapy is less popular today than formerly; many newer therapies-Gestalt, bioenergetics, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112219-transactional.org][transactional]] analysis, to name only a few-claim to produce quicker results.
- In any case, psychotherapy (si-kO-THAIR'-a-pee)_ of one sort or another is the [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112219-indicated.org][indicated]] treatment for Psychogenic (or psycho- somatic) disorders, or for any personality disturbances. The practitioner is a [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112219-psychotherapist.org][psychotherapist]] (si-ko-THAIR'-a-pist) or therapist, for short; the adjective is [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112219-psychotherapeutic.org][psychotherapeutic]] (si-ko-thair'-a- PYOO'-tik).
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[[file:./EnglishWord/2020112219-psychopathy.org][Psychopathy]] is usually [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112219-characterized.org][characterized]] by antisocial and extremely egocentric behavior. A psychopath (Sl'-ka-path'), sometimes called a psychopathic personality, appears to be lacking an inner moral censor, and often commits criminal acts, without anxiety or guilt, in order to obtain immediate [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112219-gratification.org][gratification]] of desires. Such a person may be [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112219-utterly.org][utterly]] lacking in sexual [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112219-restraint.org][restraint]], or addicted to hard drugs.

*** ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS
**** the whole tooth
- Orthodontist, as we discovered in Chapter 4, is built on ~orthos~, straight, correct, plus ~odontos~, tooth. 
- A [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112308-pedodontist.org][pedodontist]] (pee'-do-DON'-tist) specializes in the care of children's teeth-the title is constructed from ~paidos~, child, plus
~odontos~. The specialty: pedodontia (pee'-do-DON'-sha); the adjective: pedodontic (pee'-do-DON'-tik).
- A [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112308-periodontist.org][periodontist]] (pair'-ee-0-DON'-tist) is a [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112308-gum.org][gum]] specialist--=-the term combines ~odontos~ with the prefix ~peri-~, around, surrounding. (As a quick glance in the mirror will tell you, the gums surround the teeth, more or less.)
- Can you figure out the word for · the specialty?
- For the adjective? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
- An [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112308-endodontist.org][endodontist]] (en'-do-DON'-tist) specializes in work on the [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112308-pulp.org][pulp]] of the tooth and in root- ~canal~ therapy-the prefix in this term is ~endo~, from .Greek ~endon~, inner, within.
- Try your. hand again ·at .constructing words. What is the specialty? . And the adjective?
- The prefix ex-, out, combines with ~odontos~ to form [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112308-exodontist.org][exodontist]] (eks'-0-DON'-tist). What do you suppose, therefore, is the work in which this practitioner specializes? - - - - - - - - - -

****  measurement
- The [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112210-optometrist.org][optometrist]], by etymology, measures vision-the term is built on ~opsis~, ~optikos~, view, vision, plus ~metron~, measurement. Metron is the root in many other words:
- thermometer (th::ir-MOM'-G-t::ir)-an instrument to meas- ure heat (Greek therme, heat).
- [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112308-barometer.org][barometer]] (bG-ROM'-G-ter)-an instrument to measure atmospheric pressure (Greek ~baros~, weight); the adjective is barometric (bair'-G-MET'-rik).
- [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112308-sphygmomanometer.org][sphygmomanometer]] (sfig'-mo-m::i-NOM'-::i-t::ir)-a device for measuring blood pressure (Greek ~sphygmos~, pulse).
- metric system-a decimal system of weights and measures, long used in other countries and now gradually being adopted in the United States.
**** bones, feet, and hands
- [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112308-osteopath.org][Osteopath]] combines Greek ~osteon~, bone, with ~pathos~, suffering, disease. Osteopathy (os'-tee-OP'-::i-thee), you will recall, was originally based on the theory that disease is caused by pressure of the bones on blood vessels and nerves. An osteopathic (os'-tee-::i- PATH'-ik) physician is not a bone specialist, despite the misleading etymology-and should not be confused with the [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112209-orthopedist.org][orthopedist]], who is.
- The [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112217-podiatrist.org][podiatrist]] (Greek ~pous~, ~podos~, foot, plus ~iatreia~, medical healing) practices podiatry (p::i-DI'-G-tree). The adjective is po- diatric (po'-dee-A T'-rik).
- The root ~pous~, ~podos~ is found also in:
- [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112308-octopus.org][octopus]] (OK'-b-p::is), the eight-armed (or, as the etymol-ogy has it, eight-footed) sea creature (Greek ~okto~, eight).
- [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112308-platypus.org][platypus]] (PLAT'-::icp::is), the strange water mammal with a duck's [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112308-bill.org][bill]], [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112308-webbed.org][webbed]] feet, and a [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112308-beaver.org][beaver]] -like tail that reproduces by laying eggs (Greek ~platys~, broad, flat-hence, by etymology, a flatfoot!).
- podium (PO'-dee-::im), a speaker's platform, etymologically a place for the feet. (The suffix ~-ium~ often signifies "place where," as in [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112308-gymnasium.org][gymnasium]], [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112308-stadium.org][stadium]], [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112308-auditorium.org][auditorium]], etc.) 
- tripod (TRI'-pod), a three-legged (or "footed") stand for a camera or other device {tri-, three).
- [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112308-chiropodist.org][chiropodist]] (ka-ROP'-a-dist}, earlier title for a [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112217-podiatrist.org][podiatrist]], and still often used. The specialty is [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112308-chiropody.org][chiropody]] (h-ROP'-a-dee).
- [[roam:Chiropody]] combines ~podos~ with Greek ~cheir~, hand, spelled chiro- in English words. The term was coined in the days before labor-saving machinery and push-button devices, when people worked with their hands and developed [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112217-calluses.org][calluses]] on their upper [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112308-extremities.org][extremities]] as well as on their feet. Today most of us earn a [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112308-livelihood.org][livelihood]] in more [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112308-sedentary.org][sedentary]] occupations, and so we may develop calluses on less visible portions of our anatomy.
- [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112308-chiropractors.org][Chiropractors]] heal with their hands-the specialty is chiropractic (ki'-ro-PRAK'-tik).
- ~Cheir~ ( chiro-), hand, is the root in [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112308-chirography.org][chirography]] (ki-ROG'-ra- fee). Recalling the graph- in graphologist, can you figure out by etymology what chirography i s ? · _ - - - - - - - - - - -

** SESSION 10
*** ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS
**** writing and writers
- The Greek verb ~graphein~, to write, is the source of a great many English words.
- We know that the [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112217-graphologist.org][graphologist]] analyzes handwriting, the term combining ~graphein~ with ~logos~, science, study. The specialty is graphology (gr:i-FOL'-:i-jee), the adjective graphological (graf'-:i- LOJ' -:i-k:il) .
- [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112317-chirographer.org][Chirographer]] is built on ~graphein~ plus ~cheir~ (chiro-), hand.
- Though [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112308-chirography.org][chirography]] may be a lost art, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112407-calligraphy.org][calligraphy]] (ka-LIG'-rn- fee) is enjoying a revival. For centuries before the [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112407-advent.org][advent]] of printing, calligraphy, or [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112308-penmanship.org][penmanship]] as an artistic expression, was practiced by monks.
- A [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112407-calligrapher.org][calligrapher]] (ka-LIG'-ra-far) is called upon to design and write announcements, place cards, etc., as a touch of elegance. The adjective is calligraphic (kal'-a-GRAF'-ik). Calligraphy combines ~graphein~ with Greek ~kallos~, beauty, and so, by etymology, means beautiful writing.
- If a word exists for artistic handwriting, there must be one for the opposite--bad, scrawly, or illegible handwriting. And [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112407-indeed.org][indeed]] there is --- ~cacography~ (ka-KOG'-rn-fee), combining graphein with Greek ~kakos~, bad, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112407-harsh.org][harsh]].
- By [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112407-analogy.org][analogy]] with the forms of calligraphy, can you write the word for:

- One who uses bad or illegible handwriting?
- [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112407-pertaining.org][Pertaining]] to, or marked by, bad handwriting (adjective)?

- Graphein is found in other English words:
- [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112407-cardiograph.org][cardiograph]] (discussed in Chapter 4 )-etymologically a "heart writer" (kardia, heart).
- photograph-etymologically, "written by light" (Greek ~photos~, light).
- phonograph-etymologically, a "sound writer" (Greek ~phone~, sound).
- telegraph-etymologically a "distance writer" (Greek ~tele-~, distance).
- biography-etymologically "life writing" (Greek, ~bios~, life). (Many of these new.roots will be discussed in greater detail in later chapters.)
#+begin_quote
An entrancing word that also derives from kallos is [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112407-callipygian.org][callipygian]] (kal'-:> PJJ'-ee-:m), an adjective describing a shapely or attractive rear end, or a person so endowed-the combining root is ~pyge~, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112407-buttocks.org][buttocks]].
#+end_quote
**** aging and the old - We know that a [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112407-geriatrician.org][geriatrician]] specializes in the medical care of the elderly. The Greek word ~geras~, old age, has a derived form ~ogy~ (jair'-:m-TOL'-Q-jee), the adjective is [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112407-gerontological.org][gerontological]] (jair'- :m-t:i-LOJ'-a-hl). ~geron~, old man, the root in [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112217-gerontologist.org][gerontologist]]. The [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112407-specialty.org][specialty]] is [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112407-gerontology.org][gerontology]] (jair'-:m-TOL'-Q-jee), the adjective is gerontological (jair'- :m-t:i-LOJ'-a-hl). - The Latin word for old is ~senex~, the base on which senile, senescent, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112407-senior.org][senior]], and [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112407-senate.org][senate]] are built. 1. [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112408-senile.org][senile]] (SEE'-nil)-showing signs of the physical and/or mental [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112408-deterioration.org][deterioration]] that generally marks very old age. The noun is [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112408-senility.org][senility]] ( SQ-NJL'-Q-tee). 2. [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112408-senescent.org][senescent]] (sQ-NES'-:mt)-aging, growing old. (Note the same suffix in this word as in [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112408-adolescent.org][adolescent]], growing into an adult, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112408-convalescent.org][convalescent]], growing healthy again, and [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112408-obsolescent.org][obsolescent]], growing or becoming [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112408-obsolete.org][obsolete]].) The noun is senescence ( s:i-NES' -ans) . 3. [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112407-senior.org][senior]] (SEEN'-y:ir)-older. Noun: seniority (seen-YA WR'- Q-tee). 4. senate (SEN'-:it)-originally a council of older, and presumably [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112408-wiser.org][wiser]], citizens.

*** BECOMING WORD-CONSCIOUS
- Perhaps, if you have been working as [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112408-assiduously.org][assiduously]] with this book as I have repeatedly [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112408-counseled.org][counseled]], you have noticed an interesting [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112408-phenomenon.org][phenomenon]].
- This phenomenon is as follows: You read a magazine article and suddenly you see one or more of the words you have recently learned. Or you open a book and there again are some of the words you have been working with. In short, all your reading seems to call to your attention the very words you've been study ing ..
- Why? Have I, with [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112408-uncanny.org][uncanny]] foresight, picked words which have
- suddenly and [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112408-inexplicably.org][inexplicably]] become popular among writers? Obviously, that's nonsense.
- The change is in you. You have now begun to be alert to words, you have developed what is known in psychology as a "mind-set" toward certain words. Therefore, whenever these words occur in your reading you take special notice of them.
- The same words occurred before-and just as plentifully-but since they presented little communication to you, you reacted to them with an unseeing eye, with an ungrasping mind. You were [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112110-figuratively.org][figuratively]], and almost [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112408-literally.org][literally]], [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112408-blind.org][blind]] to them.
- Do you remember when you bought, or contemplated buying, a new car? Let's say it was a Toyota. Suddenly you began to see Toyotas all around you-you had a Toyota "mind-set"
- It is thus with anything new in your life. Development of a "mind-set" means that the new experience has become very real, very important, almost vital.
- If you have become suddenly [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112408-alert.org][alert]] to the new words you have been learning, you're well along toward your goal of building a superior vocabulary. You are beginning to live in a new and different [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112408-intellectual.org][intellectual]] atmosphere-nothing less!
- On the other hand, if the phenomenon I have been describing has not yet occurred, do not despair. It will. I am alerting you to its possibilities-recognize it and welcome it when it happens.

CLOCK: [2020-11-24 二 08:57]--[2020-11-24 二 15:48] =>  6:51
:END:
*** PREFACE
- If you think that grammar is an [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112411-exact.org][exact]] science, get ready for a shock. Grammar is a science, all right-but it is most [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112409-inexact.org][inexact]]. There are no [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112408-inflexible.org][inflexible]] laws, no absolutely hard and fast rules, no unchanging principles. Correctness varies with the times and depends much more on geography, on social class, and on collective human [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112408-caprice.org][caprice]] than on the restrictions found in textbooks.
- In mathematics, which is an exact science, five and five make ten the country over-in the North, in the South, in the West; in Los Angeles and Coral Gables and New York. There are no two opinions on the matter we are dealing, so far as we know, with a universal and indisputable fact.
- In grammar, however, since the facts are highly [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112219-susceptible.org][susceptible]] to change, we have to keep an eye [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112408-peeled.org][peeled]] for [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112409-trends.org][trends]]. What are educated people saying these days? Which expressions are generally used and accepted on educated levels, which others are more or less restricted to the less educated levels of speech? The answers to these questions [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112219-indicate.org][indicate]] the trend of usage in the United States, and if such trends come in conflict with academic rules, then the rules are no longer of any great importance. 
- Grammar follows the speech habits of the majority of educated people-not the other way around. That is the important point to keep in mind.
- The following notes on current trends in modern usage are intended to help you come to a decision about certain controversial expressions. As you read each sentence, pay particular attention to the [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112409-italicized.org][italicized]] word or words. Does the usage square with your own language [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112409-patterns.org][patterns]]? Would you be willing to [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112409-phrase.org][phrase]] your thoughts in just such terms? Decide whether the sentence is right or wrong, then compare your conclusion with the opinions given following the test.
*** Examples
**** Let's keep this between you and I.
- WRONG. Children are so frequently corrected by piirents and teachers when they say me that they cannot be blamed if they begin to think that this simple syllable is probably a naughty word. Dialogues such as the following are certainly typical of many households.
- "Mother, can me and Johnnie go out and play?"
- "No, dear, not until you say it correctly. You mean 'May John-
- nie and I go out to play?' "
- "Who wants a jelly apple?"
- "Me!"
- "Then use the proper word."
- (The child becomes a little confused at this point-there seem
- to be so many "ptoper" and "improper" words.)
- "Me, please!"
- "No, dear, not me."
- "Oh. I, please?"
- (This sounds terrible to a child's ear. It completely violates his sense of language, but he does want the jelly apple, so he grudgingly conforms.)
- "Who broke my best [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112411-vase.org][vase]]?"
- "It wasn't me!"
- "Is that good English, Johnnie?"
- "Okay, it wasn't I. But honest, Mom, it wasn't me-I didn't even touch it!"
- And so, if the child is strong enough to survive such constant corrections, he decides that whenever there is room for doubt, it is safer to say I. Some adults, conditioned in childhood by the kind of misguided censorship detailed here, are likely to believe that "between you and I" is the more elegant form of expression, but most educated
- speakers, obeying the rule that a preposition
**** I'm your best friend, ain't I?
- WRONG. As linguistic scholars have frequently pointed out, it is unfortunate that ain't I? is unpopular in educated speech, for the phrase fills a long-felt need. Am I not? is too [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112411-prissy.org][prissy]] for down-to-earth people; amn't I? is ridiculous; and aren't I, though popular in England, has never really caught on in America. With a sentence like the one under discussion you are practically in a linguistic trap-there is no way out unless you are willing to choose between appearing illiterate, sounding prissy, or feeling ridiculous.
- "What is the matter with ain't I? for am I not?" language scholar Wallace Rice once wrote. "Nothing whatever, save that a number of minor grammarians object to it. Ain't I? has a pleasant sound once the ears are unstopped of prejudice." Mr. Rice has a valid point there, ·yet educated people avoid ain't I? as if it were catching. In all honesty, therefore, I must say to you: don't use ain't I?, except humorously. What is a safe substitute? Apparently none exists, so I suggest that you manage, by some linguistic [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112411-calisthenics.org][calisthenics]], to avoid having to make a choice. Otherwise you may find yourself in the position of being damned if you do and damned if you don't.

**** Five and five is ten.
RIGHT. But don't jump to the conclusion that "five and five are ten" is wrong-both verbs are equaliy acceptable in this or any similar construction. If you prefer to think of "five-and-five" as a single mathematical concept, say is. If you find it more reasonable to consider "five and five" a plural idea, say are. The teachers I've polled on this point are about evenly divided in preference, and so, I imagine, are the rest of us. Use whichever verb has the greater appeal to your sense of logic.

**** I never saw a man get so mad.
- RIGHT. When I questioned a number of authors and editors about their opinion of the acceptability of mad as a synonym for angry, the typical reaction was: "Yes, I say mad, but I always feel a little guilty when I do."
- Most people do say mad when they are sure there is no English teacher listening; it's a good sharp word, everybody understands exactly what it means, and it's a lot stronger than angry, though not quite as violent as furious or enraged. In short, mad has a special implication offered by no other word in the English language; as a consequence, educated people use it as the occasion [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112411-demands.org][demands]] and it is perfectly correct. So correct, in fact, that every authoritative dictionary lists it as a completely acceptable usage. If you feel guilty when you say mad, even though you don't mean insane, it's time you stopped [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112411-plaguing.org][plaguing]] your conscience with trivialities.
**** Every one of his sisters are unmarried.
- WRONG. Are is perhaps the more logical word, since the sentence implies that he has more than one sister and they are alI unmarried. In educated speech, however, the tendency is to make the verb agree with the subject, even if logic is violated in the process-and the better choice here would. be is, agreeing with the singular subject, every one.
**** He visited an optometrist for an eye operation.
- WRONG. If the gentleman in question did indeed need an operation, he went to the wrong doctor. In most states, optometrists are forbidden by law to perform surgery or administer drugs- they may only prescribe and fit glasses. And they are not medical doctors. The M.D. who specializes in the treatment of eye diseases, and who may operate when necessary, is an [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112209-ophthalmologist.org][ophthalmologist]]. (See· Chapter 4.)
**** Do you [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112411-prophecy.org][prophecy]] another world war?
WRONG. Use prophecy only when you mean prediction, a noun. When you mean predict, a verb, as in this sentence, use [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112411-prophesy.org][prophesy]]. This distinction is simple and foolproof. Therefore we properly say: "His ·prophecy (prediction) turned out to be true," but "He really seems able to prophesy (predict) political trends." There is a distinction also in the pronunciation of these two words. Prophecy is pronounced PROF'-a-see; prophesy is pronunced PROF'- a-si'.
**** Leave us not mention it.
WRONG. On the less sophisticated levels of American speech, leave is a popular substitute for let. On educated levels, the following distinction is carefully observed: let means allow; leave means [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112413-depart.org][depart]]. (There are a few [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112413-idiomatic.org][idiomatic]] exceptions to this rule, · but they present no problem.) "Let me go" is preferable to "Leave me go" even on the most informal of occasions, and a sentence like "Leave us not mention it" is not considered standard English.
**** If you expect to eventually succeed, you must keep trying.
- RIGHT. We have here, in case you're [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112413-puzzled.org][puzzled]], an example of that [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112317-notorious.org][notorious]] bugbear of academic grammar, the "split infinitive." (An infinitive is a verb preceded by to: to succeed, to fail, to remember.)  
- Splitting an [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112413-infinitive.org][infinitive]] is not at all difficult-you need only insert a word between the to and the verb: to eventually succeed, to completely fail, to quickly remember.
- Now that you know how to split an infinitive, the important question is, is it legal to do so? I am happy to be able to report to you that it is not only legal, it is also [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112413-ethical.org][ethical]], [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112413-moral.org][moral]], and sometimes more effective than to not split it. Benjamin Franklin, Washington Irving, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Theodore Roosevelt, and Woodrow Wilson, among many others, were [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112406-unconscionable.org][unconscionable]] infinitive splitters. And modem writers are equaliy partial to the construction.
- To bring this report up to the minute, I asked a number of editors about their attitude toward the split infinitive. Here are two typical reactions.
- An editor at Doubleday and Company: "The restriction against the split infinitive is, to my mind, the most artificial of all [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112413-grammatical.org][grammatical]] rules. I find that most educated people split infinitives reg ularly in their speech, and only eliminate them from their writing when they rewrite and polish their material."
- An editor at Reader's [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112413-digest.org][Digest]]: "I want to defend the split infinitive. The construction adds to the strength of the sentence-it's compact and clear. This is to loudly say that I split an infinitive whenever I can catch one."
- And here, finally, is the opinion of humorist James Thurber, as quoted by Rudolf Flesch in The Art of Plain Talk: "Word has somehow got around that the split infinitive is always wrong. This is of a piece with the [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112413-outworn.org][outworn]] notion that it is always wrong to [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112413-strike.org][strike]] a lady.
- I think the evidence is conclusive enough-it is perfectly correct to consciously split an infinitive whenever such an act increases the strength or clarity of your sentence. 
* HOW TO TALK ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENTISTS
** SESSION 11
- A true scientist lives up to the etymological meaning of his title "one who knows." Anything scientific is based on facts-observable facts that can be recorded, tested, checked, and verified.
- Science, then, deals with human knowledge-as far as it has gone. It has gone very far indeed since the last century or two, when we stopped basing our thinking on guesses, wishes, theories that had no foundation in reality, and concepts of how the world ought to be; and instead began to explore the world as it was, and not only the world but the whole universe. From Galileo, who looked through the first telescope atop a tower in Pisa, Italy, through Pasteur, who watched microbes through a microscope, to Einstein, who deciphered [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112414-riddles.org][riddles]] of the universe by means of mathematics, we have at last begun to fill in a few areas of ignorance.

*** ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS
**** people and the stars
- Anthropologist is constructed from roots we are familiar with- ~anthropos~, mankind, and ~logos~, science, study.
- The science is [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112110-anthropology.org][anthropology]] ( an'-thra~POL'-;;i-jee). Can you write the adjective form of this word? - - - - - - - - - (Can you pronounce it?)
- [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112415-astronomer.org][Astronomer]] is built on Greek ~astron~, star, and nomos, arrange ment, law, or order. The astronomer is interested in the arrange-ment of stars and other [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112415-celestial.org][celestial]] bodies. The science is. astronomy (Q-SlRON'-~mee), the adjective is astronomical(as'-trn- NOM'-Q-kQl), a word often used in a non-heavenly sense, as in "the astronomical size of the national debt." Astronomy deals in such enormous distances (the sun, for example, is 93,000,000 miles from the earth, and light from stars travels toward the earth at 186,000 miles per second) that the adjective astronomical is applied to any tremendoµsly large figure.
- ~Astron~, star, combines with ~logos~ to ~fonn~ astrology (Q-STROL'- ~jee), which [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112415-assesses.org][assesses]] the influence of planets and stars on human events. The practitioner is an astrologer (Q-SlROL'-Q-jQr). Can you form the adjective? . (Can you pronounce it?)
- By etymology, an astronaut (AS'-trQ-not') is a sailor among the stars (Greek nautes, sailor). This person is termed with some- what less [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112406-exaggeration.org][exaggeration]] a [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112415-cosmonaut.org][cosmonaut]] (KOZ'-m~not') by the Russians (Greek, kosmos, universe). Nautical (NOT'-a-kQl), relating to sailors, sailing, ships, or navigation, derives also from [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112415-nautes.org][nautes]], and nautes in tum is from Greek naus, ship-a root used in nau- sea (etymologically, ship-sickness or seasickness!). (etymologically, ship-sickness or seasickness!).
- Aster (AS'-tQr) is a star shaped flower. Asterisk (AS'-tQ-risk), a star-shaped symbol (*), is generally used in writing or printing to direct the reader to look for a footnote. Astrophysics (as'-~ FIZ' -iks) is that branch of physics dealing with heavenly bodies.
- Disaster (d~ZAS'-tQr) and disastrous (dQ-ZA$'-trns) also come from ~astron~, star. In ancient times it was believed that the stars ruled human destiny; any misfortune or [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112415-calamity.org][calamity]], therefore, happened to someone because the stars were in opposition. (Dis-, a prefix of many meanings, in this word signifies against.) ·
- ~Nomos~, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112415-arrangement.org][arrangement]], ~law~, or ~order~, is found in two other interesting English words.
- For example, if you can make your own laws for yourself, if you needn't answer to anyone else for what you do, in short, if you are independent, then you enjoy [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112415-autonomy.org][autonomy]] (aw-TON'-a- mee), a word that combines ~nomos~, ~law~, with ~autos~, self. Autonomy, then, is self-law, self-government. The fifty states in our nation are [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112415-fairly.org][fairly]] [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112415-autonomous.org][autonomous]] (aw-TO'N''~mQs), but not completely so. On the other hand, ·in most colleges each separate department is pretty much autonomous. And of course, one of the big reasons for the revolution of 1776 was that America wanted autonomy, rather than control by England.
- You know the instrument that beginners at the piano use to guide their timing? A pendulum swings back and forth, making an audible click at each swing, and in that way governs or orders the measure (or timing) of the player. Hence it is called a metronome (MET' -n~-nom'), a word that combines nomos with metron, measurement.
**** the earth and its life
- [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112415-geologist.org][Geologist]] derives from Greek ~ge~ (geo-), earth. The science is geology (jee-OL'-a-jee). Can you write the adjective? (Can you pronounce it?)
- Geometry (jee-OM'-a-tree)__:_ge plus ~metron~-by etymology "measurement of the earth," is that branch of [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112415-mathematics.org][mathematics]] treating of the measurement and properties of solid and plane figures, such as angles, triangles, squares, spheres, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112415-prisms.org][prisms]], etc. (The ety-
- mology of the word shows that this ancient science was originally concerned with the measurement of land and spaces on the earth.)
- The [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112415-mathematician.org][mathematician]] is a [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112415-geometrician.org][geometrician]] (jee'-a-ma•TRISH'-an), the adjective is geometric (jee'-a-MET'-rik).
- Geography (jee-OG'-ra-fee) is writing about (graphein, to write), or mapping, the earth. A practitioner of the science is a ge- ographer (Jee-OG'-ra-far), the adjective is geographic (jee-a- GRAF'-ik).
- (The name George iS also derived from ge (geo-), earth, plus ~ergon~, ~work~-the first George was an earth-worker or farmer.).
- Biologist combines ~bios~, life, with ~logos~, science, study. The science is biology (bi-OL'-a-jee). The adjective?-------
-  ~Bios~, life, is also found in biography (bi-OG'-ra-fee), writing about someone's. life; autobiography (aw'-ta-bi-OG'-ra-fee), the story of one's life written by oneself; and biopsy (Bi'-op-see), a
- medical examination, or view (~opsis~, ~optikos~, view, vision), generally through a microscope, of living tissue, frequently performed when cancer is suspected. A small part of the tissue is cut from the affected area and under the microscope its cells can be investigated for evidence of [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112415-malignancy.org][malignancy]]. A [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112415-biopsy.org][biopsy]] is contrasted with an autopsy (AW'-top-see), which is a medical examination of a [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112415-corpse.org][corpse]] in order to discover the cause of death. Th autos in autopsy means, as you know, self-in an autopsy, etymologically speaking, the surgeon or pathologist determines, by actual view or sight rather than by theorizing (i.e., "by viewing or seeing for - oneself'), what brought the corpse to its present grievous state.
- [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112415-botanist.org][Botanist]] is from Greek ~botane~, plant. The field is botany (BOT'-:i-nee); the adjective is botanical (b:i-TAN'-a-kal).
- [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112417-zoologist.org][Zoologist]] is from Greek ~zoion~, animal. The science is [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112417-zoology.org][zoology]].
- The adjective? . The combination of the two ostempts many people to pronounce the first three letters of these words in one syllable, thus: zoo. However, the two o's should be separated, as in co-operate, even though no hyphen is used in the spelling to indicate such separation. Say z0- 0L'-a-jist, z0-0L'-a-jee, zo'-a-LOJ'-a-kal. Zoo, a park for animals, is a shortened form of zoological gardens, and is, of course,
pronounced in one syllable.
- The [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112415-zodiac.org][zodiac]] (Z6'-dee-ak) is a diagram, used in astrology, of the paths of the sun, moon, and planets; it contains, in part, Latin names for various animals---scorpio, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112415-scorpion.org][scorpion]]; ~leo~, lion; ~cancer~, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112417-crab.org][crab]]; ~taurus~, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112417-bull.org][bull]]; aries, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112417-ram.org][ram]]; and [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112415-pisces.org][pisces]], fish. ~Hence~ its derivation from ~zoion~, animal.
- The adjective is [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112417-zodiacal.org][zodiacal]] (zO-Dl'-a-kal).

**** cutting in and out
- Flies, bees, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112509-beetles.org][beetles]], [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112509-wasps.org][wasps]], and other insects are [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112509-segmented.org][segmented]] creatures-head, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112509-thorax.org][thorax]], and [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112214-abdomen.org][abdomen]]. Where these parts join, there appears to the imaginative eye a "cutting in" of the body.
- Hence the branch of Zoology dealing with insects is [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112509-aptly.org][aptly]] named entomology, from Greek ~en~-, in, plus ~tome~, a cutting. The adjective is [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112509-entomological.org][entomological]] (en'-t:rma-LOJ'-a-k:il).
- (The word insect makes the same point-it is built on Latin in- in, plus ~sectus~, a form of the verb meaning to cut.)
- The prefix ~ec~-, from Greek ~ek~-, means out. (The Latin prefix, you will recall, is ex-.) Combine ec- with tome to derive the words for [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112509-surgical.org][surgical]] procedures in which parts are "cut out," or removed: [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112509-tonsillectomy.org][tonsillectomy]] (the tonsils), [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112509-appendectomy.org][appendectomy]] (the [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112509-appendix.org][appendix]]), [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112509-mastectomy.org][mastectomy]] (the breast), [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112509-hysterectomy.org][hysterectomy]] (the uterus), [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112509-prostatectomy.org][prostatectomy]] (the prostate), etc.
- Combine ~ec~- with Greek ~kentron~, center (the Latin root, as we have discovered, is ~centrum~), to derive [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112509-eccentric.org][eccentric]] (:ik-SEN'-trik)- out of the center, hence [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112509-deviating.org][deviating]] from the normal in behavior, attitudes, etc., or unconventional, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112509-odd.org][odd]], strange. Thti noun is ec- [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112509-centricity.org][centricity]] ( ek'-s:in-TRIS' -:rtee).

**** more cuts
- The Greek prefix ~a~- makes a root negative; the ~atom~ (AT'-am) was so named at a time when it was considered the smallest possible particle of an element, that is, one that could not be cut any further. (We have long since split the atom, of course, with results, as in most technological advances, both good and evil.) The adjective is atomic (a-TOM'-ik).
- The Greek prefix ~ana~- has a number of meanings, one of which is up, as in anatomy (a-NAT'-a-mee), originally the cutting up of a plant or animal to determine its structure, later the bodily structure itself. The adjective is [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112509-anatomical.org][anatomical]] (an' -a-TOM' -a-kal) .
- Originally any book that was part of a larger work of many volumes was called a [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112509-tome.org][tome]] (TOM)-etymologically, a part cut from the whole. Today, a tome [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112509-designates.org][designates]], often [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112509-disparagingly.org][disparagingly]], an ex- ceptionally large book, or one that is heavy and dull in content.
- The Greek prefix ~dicha~-, in two, combines with tome to construct [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112509-dichotomy.org][dichotomy]] (dI-KOT'-a-mee), a splitting in two, a technical word used in [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112509-astronomy.org][astronomy]], biology, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112509-botany.org][botany]], and the science of logic. It is also employed as a non-technical term, as when we refer to the dichotomy in the life of a man who is a government clerk all day and a night-school teacher after working hours, so that his life is, in a sense, split into two parts. The verb is [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112509-dichotomize.org][dichotomize]] (di- KOT'-a-rniz'); the adjective is [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112509-dichotomous.org][dichotomous]] (dI-KOT'-a-mas). Dichotomous thinking is the sort that divides everything into two parts-good and bad; white and black; Democrats and Republicans; etc. An unknown wit has made this classic statement about dichotomous thinking: "There are two kinds of people: those who divide everything into two parts, and those who do not."
- Imagine a book, a [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112509-complicated.org][complicated]] or massive report, or some other [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112215-elaborate.org][elaborate]] document-now figuratively cut on or through it so that you can get to its essence, the very heart of the idea contained in it. What you have is an [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112509-epitome.org][epitome]] (a-PIT'-a-mee), a [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112509-condensation.org][condensation]] of the whole. (From ~epi~-, on, upon, plus tome.)
- An epitome may refer to a summary, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112509-condensation.org][condensation]], or [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112510-abridgment.org][abridgment]] of language, as in "Let me have an epitome of the book," or "Give me the epitome of his speech."
- More commonly, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112509-epitome.org][epitome]] and the verb epitomize (a-PIT'-a- miz') are used in sentences like "She is the epitome of kindness," or "That one act epitomizes her philosophy of life." If you cut everything else away to get to the essential part, that part is a [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112311-representative.org][representative]] cross-section of the whole. So a woman who is the epitome of kindness stands for all people who are kind; and an act that epitomizes a philosophy of life represents, by itself,the complete philosophy.

**** more love
- [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112510-philanthropy.org][Philanthropy]] (fa-LAN'-thN-pee) is by etymology the love of mankind-one who devotes oneself to philanthropy is a [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112110-philanthropist.org][philanthropist]] (fa-LAN'-thra-pist), as we learned in Chapter 3; the adjective is [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112510-philanthropic.org][philanthropic]] (fil-Qn-THROP'-ik).
- The verb [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112019-philander.org][philander]] (fa-LAN'-dQr), to "play around" sexually, be [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112510-promiscuous.org][promiscuous]], or have [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112510-extramarital.org][extramarital]] relations, combines ~philein~ with ~andros~, male. (Philandering, despite its derivation, is not of course exclusively the male province. The word is, in fact, derived from the proper name conventionally given to male lovers in plays and romances of the 1500s and 1600s.) One who engages in the interesting activities [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112510-catalogued.org][catalogued]] above is a philanderer (fa- LAN'-dQr-Qr).
- By etymology, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112510-philosophy.org][philosophy]] is the love of ~wisdom~ (Greek ~sophos~, wise); [[roam:Philadelphia]] is the City of Brotherly Love (Greek ~adelphos~, brother); [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112510-philharmonic.org][philharmonic]] is the love of music or harmony (Greek harmonia, harmony); and a [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112510-philter.org][philter]], a rarely used word, is a love [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112510-potion.org][potion]]. Today we call whatever [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112510-arouses.org][arouses]] sexual desire an [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112510-aphrodisiac.org][aphrodisiac]] (af-rn-DIZ'-ee-ak'), from [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112510-aphrodite.org][Aphrodite]], the Greek godness of love and beauty. 
- Aphrodisiac is an adjective as well as a noun, but a longer adjective form, aphrodisiacal ( af-rn-da-ZI' -a-kal), is also used.
- A [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112510-bibliophile.org][bibliophile]] (BIB'-lee-a-ffi') is one who loves books as collectibles, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112510-admiring.org][admiring]] their binding, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112510-typography.org][typography]], [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112510-illustrations.org][illustrations]], [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112510-rarity.org][rarity]], etc.-in short, a book collector. The combining root is Greek ~biblion~, book.
- An [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112511-anglophile.org][Anglophile]] (ANG'-gl:i-ffi') admires and is fond of the British people, customs, culture, etc. The combining root is Latin ~Anglus~, English.
**** words and how they affect people
- The [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112414-semanticist.org][semanticist]] is professionally involved in ~semantics~ ( sa- MAN'-tiks). The adjective is [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112510-semantic.org][semantic]] (s:i-MAN'-tik) or semantical (sQ-MAN'-ta-kal).
- Semantics, like orthopedics, pediatrics, and obstetrics, is a singular noun despite the -s ending. Semantics is, not are, an exciting study. However, this rule applies only when we refer to the word as a science or area of study. In the following sentence, semantics is used as a [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112111-plural.org][plural]]: ''The semantics of your thinking are all wrong."
- Two stimulating and highly readable books on the subject, well worth a visit to the h'brary to pick up, are Language in Thought and Action, by S. I. Hayakawa, and People in [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112511-quandaries.org][Quandaries]] by Dr. Wendell Johnson.
**** how people live 
- The profession of the [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112510-sociologist.org][sociologist]] is sociology (so'-shee-OL'-a- jee or sO-see-OL'-:i-jee). Can you write, and pronounce, the adjective?
- Sociology is built on Latin ~socius~, companion,* plus logos, science, study. Socius is the source of such common words as associate, social, socialize, society, sociable, and antisocial; as well as asocial (ay-SO'-shal), which combines the negative prefix ~a~- with socius.
- The antisocial person actively dislikes people, and often behaves in ways that are [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112510-detrimental.org][detrimental]] or destructive to society or the social order (anti-, against). 
- On the other hand, someone who is asocial is withdrawn and self-centered, avoids contact with others, and feels completely indifferent to the interests or welfare of society. The [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112510-asocial.org][asocial]] person doesn't want to "get involved."
#+begin_quote
Companion itself has an interesting etymology-Latin ~com~-, with, plus ~panis~, bread. If you are social, you enjoy breaking bread with companions. Pantry also comes from panis, though far more than bread is stored there.

** WHERE TO GET NEW IDEAS
- People with superior vocabularies, I have [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112514-submitted.org][submitted]], are the people with ideas. The words they know are verbal symbols of the ideas they are familiar with-reduce one and you must reduce the other, for ideas cannot exist without verbalization. Freud once had an idea-and had to coin a whole new vocabulary to make
- his idea clear to the world. Those who are familiar with Freud's theories know all the words that explain them-the unconscious, the ego, the id, the superego, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112514-rationalization.org][rationalization]], [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112514-oedipus.org][Oedipus]] complex, and so on. Splitting the atom was once a new idea-anyone familiar with it knew something about [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112514-fission.org][fission]], isotope, radioactive, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112514-cyclotron.org][cyclotron]], etc.
- Remember this: your vocabulary indicates the alertness and range of your mind. The words you know show the [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112514-extent.org][extent]] of your understanding of what's going on in the world. The size of your vocabulary varies directly with the degree to which you are growing intellectually.
- You have covered so far in this book several hundred words. 
- Having learned these words, you have begun to think of an equal number of new ideas. A new word is not just another pattern of syllables with which to [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112514-clutter.org][clutter]] up your mind-a new word is a new idea to help you think, to help you understand the thoughts of others, to help you expre~ your own thoughts, to help you live a [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112514-richer.org][richer]] intellectual life.
- Realizing these facts, you may become impatient. You will begin to doubt that a book like this can cover all the ideas that an alert and intellectually mature adult wishes to be [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112514-acquainted.org][acquainted]] with.
- Your doubt is well-founded. One of the chief purposes of this book is to get you started, to give you enough of a push so that you will begin to gather [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112514-momentum.org][momentum]], to stimtilate you enough so that you will want to start gathering your own ideas.
- Where can you gather them? From good books on new topics. How can you gather them? By reading on a wide range of new subjects. -
- Reference has repeatedly been made to psychology, psychiatry, and psychoanalysis in these pages. If your curiosity has been [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112514-piqued.org][piqued]] by these references, here is a good place to start. In these fields there is a [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112514-tremendous.org][tremendous]] and exciting literature-and you can read as widely and as deeply as you wish.
- What I would like to do is offer a few suggestions as to where you might [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112514-profitably.org][profitably]] begin-how far you go will depend on your own interest.
- I suggest, first, half a dozen .older books (older, but still im- mensely valuable and completely valid) available at any large public library.
- The Human Mind, by Karl A. Menninger
- Mind and Body, by Flanders Dunbar
- The Mind in Action, by Eric Berne
- Understandable Psychiatry, by Leland E. Hinsie
- A General Introduction to Psychoanalysis, by Sigmund Freud
- Emotional Problems of Living, by 0. Spurgeon English and
- Gerald H.J. Pearson
- Next, I suggest books on some of the newer approaches in psychology. These are available in inexpensive paperback editions as well .as at your local library.
- I Ain't Well-But I Sure Am Better, by Jess Lair, Ph.D ..
- The Disowned Self, by Nathaniel Brandon
- A Primer of Behavioral Psychology, by Adelaide Bry

*** HOW TO A VOID BEING A PURIST
- Life, as you no doubt realize, is complicated enough these days.
- Yet [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112514-puristic.org][puristic]] textbooks and English teachers with puristic ideas are [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112514-striving.org][striving]] to make it still more complicated. Their contribution to the [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112514-complexity.org][complexity]] of modern living is the repeated claim that many of the natural, carefree, and popular expressions that most of us use every day are "bad English," "incorrect grammar," "vulgar" or "illiterate"
- In truth, many of the former restrictions and "thoushalt nots" of academic grammar are now outmoded-most educated speakers quite simply ignore them.
- Students in my grammar cfasses at Rio Hondo College are somewhat [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112514-nonplused.org][nonplused]] when they discover that correctness is not determined by textbook rules and cannot be enforced by school teacher edict. They invariably ask: "Aren't you going to draw the line somewhere?"
- It is neither necessary nor possible for any one person to "draw the line." That is done--and quite effectively-by the people themselves, by the millions of educated people throughout the nation.
- Of course certain expressions may be considered "incorrect" or "illiterate" or "bad grammar''-not because they violate puristic rules, but only because they are rarely if  ever used by educated speakers.
- Correctness, in short, is determined by current educated usage.
- The following notes on current trends in modern usage are intended to help you come to a decision about certain controversial expressions. As you read each sentence, pay particular attention to the italicized word or words. Does the usage [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112216-square.org][square]] with your own language patterns? Would you be willing to [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112409-phrase.org][phrase]] your thoughts in just such terms? Decide whether the sentence is "right" or "wrong," then compare your conclusions with the opinions given after the test.
*** TEST YOURSELF
**** Let's not walk any further right now.
- RIGHT. In the nineteenth century, when professional grammarians attempted to [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112514-latinize.org][Latinize]] English grammar, an artificial distinction was drawn between farther and further, to wit: [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112514-farther.org][farther]] refers to space, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112514-further.org][further]] means to a greater extent or additional. Today, as a result, many teachers who are still under the [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112514-forbidding.org][forbidding]] influence of nineteenth-century restrictions insist that it is incorrect to use one word for the other.
- To check on current attitudes toward this distinction, I sent the test sentence above to a number of dictionary editors, authors, and professors of English, requesting their opinion of the [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112514-acceptability.org][acceptability]] of further in, reference to actual distance. Sixty out of eighty-seven professors, over two thirds of those responding, accepted the usage without qualification. Of twelve dictionary editors, eleven accepted further, and in the case of the authors, thirteen out of twenty-three accepted the word as used. A professor of English at Cornell University remarked: "I know of no justification for any present-day distinction between further and farther"; and a consulting editor of the Funk· and Wagnalls dictionary said, "There is nothing controversial here. As applied to [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112514-spatial.org][spatial]] distance, further and farther have long been interchangeable."
- Perhaps the comment of a noted author and columnist is most to the point: "I like both further and farther, as I have never been able to tell which is which or why one is any farther or further than the other."
**** Some people admit that their principle goal in life is to become wealthy
- WRONG. In speech, you can get principal and principle confused as often as you like, and no one will ever know the difference-both words are pronounced identically. In writing, however, your spelling will give you away.
- There is a simple memory trick that will help you if you get into trouble with these two words. Rule and principle both end in -le- and a principle is a rule. On the other hand, principal contains an a, and so does main-and [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112515-principal.org][principal]] means main. Get these points straight and your confusion is over.
- Heads of schools are called principals, because they are the main person in that institution of learning. The money you have in the bank is your principal, your main financial [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112515-assets.org][assets]]. And the stars of a play are prineipals-the main actors.
- Thus, "Some people admit that their principal (main) goal in life is to become wealthy," but "Such a principle (rule) is not guaranteed to lead to happiness."
**** what a nice thing to say
- RIGHT. Purists object to the popular use of nice as a [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112515-synonym.org][synonym]] for pleasant, agreefible, or [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112414-delightful.org][delightful]]. They wish to [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112515-restrict.org][restrict]] the word to its older and more [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112515-erudite.org][erudite]] meaning of exact or subtle.
- You will be happy to hear that they aren't getting any where.
- When I [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112515-polled.org][polled]] a group of well-known authors on the acceptability in everyday speech of the popular meaning of nice, their opinions were [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112515-unanimous.org][unanimous]]; not a single [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112515-dissenting.org][dissenting]] voice, out of the twenty-three authors who answered, was raised against the usage.
- One writer responded: "It has been right for about 150 years Editors of magazines and newspapers questioned on the same point were just a shade more conservative. Sixty out of sixty-nine accepted the usage. One editor commented: "I think we do not have to be nice about nice any longer. No one can eradicate it from popular speech as a synonym for pleasant, or enjoyable, or kind, or [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112515-courteous.org][courteous]]. It is a [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112515-workhorse.org][workhorse]] of the vocabulary, and properly so."
- The only valid objection to the word is that it is overworked by some people, but this shows a weakness, in vocabulary rather than in grammar.
- As in the famous story of the editor who said to her [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112515-secretary.org][secretary]] :"There are two words I wish you would stop using so much. One is 'nice' and the other is [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112515-lousy.org]['lousy]]'"
- "Okay," said the secretary, who was eager to please "What are they?"
**** He's pretty sick today
RIGHT, One of the purist's [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112515-pet.org][pet]] targets of attack is the word pretty as used in the sentence under discussion. Yet all modern dictionaries accept such use of pretty, and a [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112515-survey.org][survey]] made by a professor at the University of Wisconsin showed that the usage is established English.
**** I feel awfully sick.
- RIGHT. Dictionaries accept this usage in informal speech and the University of Wisconsin survey showed that it is established English.
- The great popularity of awfully in educated speech is no doubt due to the strong and unique [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112515-emphasis.org][emphasis]] that the word gives to an adjective- [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112515-substitute.org][substitute]] very, quite, extremely, or severely-and you considerably weaken the force.
- On the other hand, it is somewhat less than [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112515-cultivated.org][cultivated]] to say "I feel awful sick," and the wisdom of using awfully to [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112515-intensify.org][intensify]] a pleasant concept ("What an awfully pretty child"; "That book is awfully interesting") is perhaps still [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112515-debatable.org][debatable]], though getting less and less so as the years go on.
**** Are you going to invite Doris and I to your party?
- WRONG. Some people are almost [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112515-irresistibly.org][irresistibly]] drawn to the pronoun I in constructions like this one. However, not only does such use of I violate a valid and useful grammatical principle, but, more important, it is rarely heard in educated speech. The meaning of the sentence is equally clear no matter which form of the pronoun is employed, of course, but the use of I, the less popular choice, may [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112515-stigmatize.org][stigmatize]] the speaker as uneducated.
- Consider it this way: You would normally say, "Are you going to invite me to your party?" It would be wiser, therefore, to say, "Are you going to invite Doris and me to your party?"
* HOW TO TALK ABOUT LIARS AND LYING
** SESSION 14
- It was the famous Greek [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112515-philosopher.org][philosopher]] and [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112515-cynic.org][cynic]] [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112515-diogenes.org][Diogenes]] ·who went around the streets of [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112515-athens.org][Athens]], lantern in hand, looking for an honest person.
- This was over two thousand years ago, but I [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112515-presume.org][presume]] that [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112515-diogenes.org][Diogenes]] would have as little success in his searcl). today. Lying seems to be an integral weakness of mortal character-I doubt that few human beings would be so [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112516-brash.org][brash]] as to claim that they have never in their lives told at least a partial untruth. Indeed, one [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112414-philologist.org][philologist]] goes so far as to [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112516-theorize.org][theorize]] that language must have been invented for the sole purpose of deception. Perhaps so. It is certainly true that animals seem somewhat more honest than humans, maybe because they are less gifted mentally.
- Why do people lie? To increase their sense of importance, to escape punishment, to gain and end that would otherwise be denied them, out of long-standing habit, or sometimes because they actually do not know the differepce between fact and fancy. These are the common reasons for falsification. No doubt there are other, fairly unique, motives that [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112516-impel.org][impel]] people to distort the truth. And, to come right down to it, can we always be certain what is true and what is false?
- If lying is a prevalent and all-too-human phenomenon, there would of course be a number of interesting words to describe different types of liars. · Let us pretend (not to get personal, but only to help you become personally involved in the ideas and words) that you are a liar. The question is, what kind of liar are you?
** IDEAS

*** beyond [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112317-redemption.org][redemption]] or [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112317-salvation.org][salvation]]
- You are [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112317-impervious.org][impervious]] to correction. Often as you may be caught in your fabrications, there is no reforming you-you go right on lyng despite~ the punishment, embarrassment, or unhappiness that your distortions of truth may bring upon you.
- An [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112019-incorrigible.org][incorrigible]] liar
*** too old to learn new tricks
- You are the victim of firmly fixed and deep-rooted habits. Telling untruths is as frequent and customary an activity as brushing your teeth in the morning, or having toast and coffee for breakfast, or lighting up a cigarette after dinner (if you are a smoker). And almost as [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112317-reflexive.org][reflexive]].
- An [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112317-inveterate.org][inveterate]] liar
*** an early start
- You have such a long history of persistent [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112405-falsification.org][falsification]] that one can only suspect that your [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112406-vice.org][vice]] started when you were reposing in your mother's womb. In other words, and allowing for a great deal of [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112406-exaggeration.org][exaggeration]] for effect, you have been lying from the moment of your birth.
*** no [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112406-letup.org][letup]]
 A [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112406-congenital.org][congenital]] liar
- You never stop lying. While normal people lie on occasion, and often for special reasons, you lie continually-not occasionally or even frequently, but over and over.
*** a strange disease
A [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112406-chronic.org][chronic]] liar
- You are not concerned with the difference between truth and falsehood; you do not bother to distinguish fact from fantasy. In fact, your lying is a disease that no antibiotic can cure.
*** no [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112406-regrets.org][regrets]]
A pathological liar
- You are completely without a conscience. No matter what [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112406-misery.org][misery]] your [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112406-fabrications.org][fabrications]] may cause your innocent victims, you never feel the slightest [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112406-twinge.org][twinge]] of guilt. Totally [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112406-unscrupulous.org][unscrupulous]], you are a dangerous person to get mixed up with.
*** smooth!
An [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112406-unconscionable.org][unconscionable]] liar
- [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112406-possessed.org][Possessed]] of a lively imagination and a ready tongue, you can [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112406-distort.org][distort]] facts as smoothly and as effortlessly as you can say your name. But you do not always get away with your lies.
- Ironically enough, it is your very smoothness that makes you suspect: your answers are too quick to be true. Even if we can't immediately catch you in your lies, we have learned from unhappy past experience not to suspend our critical faculties when you are talking. We admire your [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112406-nimble.org][nimble]] [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112406-wit.org][wit]], but we listen with a [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112406-skeptical.org][skeptical]] ear.
*** outstanding!
A [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112406-glib.org][glib]] liar
- Lies, after all, are bad-they are frequently injurious to other people, and may have a particularly dangerous effect on you as a liar. At best, if you are caught you suffer some embarrassment. At worst, if you succeed in your [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112406-deception.org][deception]] your character becomes [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112406-warped.org][warped]] and your sense of values suffers. Almost all lies are harmful; some are no Jess than vicious.
- If you are one type of liar, all your lies are vicious calculatedly, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112406-predeterminedly.org][predeterminedly]], coldly, and [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112406-advisedly.org][advisedly]] vicious. In short, your lies are so outstandingly hurtful that people [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112406-gasp.org][gasp]] in amazement and disgust at hearing them.
An [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112406-egregious.org][egregious]] liar

In this chapter the ten basic words revolve rather closely around a central core. Each one, however, has a distinct, a unique mean- ing, a special implication. Note the differences.

| TYPE OF LIAR        | SPECIAL IMPLICATION                                                                             |

| inveterate          | an inveterate smoker (this adjective, like notorious, usually has an unfavor- able connotation) |

** SESSION 15
*** ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS
**** well-known
- "Widely but unfavorably known" is the common definition for [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112317-notorious.org][notorious]]. Just as a notorious liar is well-known for unreliable [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112516-statements.org][statements]], so a notorious gambler, a notorious thief, or a notorious killer has achieved a wide reputation for some form of antisocial behavior. The noun is notoriety (no-ta-RI'-a-tee).
- The derivation is from Latin notus, known, from which we also get noted. It is an interesting characteristic of some words that a change of syllables can alter the emotional impact. Thus, an admirer of certain business executives will speak of them as "noted industrialists"; these same people's enemies will call them "notorious exploiters" Similarly, if we admire a man's or a woman's unworldliness, we refer to it by the complimentary term childlike; but if we are annoyed by the [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112516-trait.org][trait]], we describe it, derogatively, as childish. Change "-like" to "-ish" and our emotional tone undergoes a complete reversal.
**** plenty of room at the top
- The top of a mountain is called, as you know, the [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112516-summit.org][summit]], a word derived from Latin summus, highest, which also gives us the mathematical term sum, as in addition. A consummate artist has reached the very highest point of perfection; and to consummate (KON' -sa-mayt') a marriage, a business deal, or a contract is, etymologically, to bring it to the highest point; that is, to put the final touches to it, to bring it to completion.
- [Note how differently consummate (kan-SUM'-at), the ,adjective, is pronounced from the verb to consummate (KON' -sa- mayt') ]. Nouns are formed from adjectives by the addition of the noun suffix -ness: sweet-sweetness; simple--simpleness; envious-en- viousness; etc.
- Many adjectives, however, have alternate noun forms, and the adjective consummate is one of them. To make a noun out of consummate, add either -ness or -acy; consummateness (kan-SUM' -
- Qt-nas) or constimmacy (kan-SUM'-a-see). Verbs ending in -ate ~variably tack on the noun suffix -ion to form nouns: create--creation; evaluate-evaluation; etc.
- Can you write the noun form of the verb to consummate?
**** no help
- Call people [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112019-incorrigible.org][incorrigible]] (in-KA WR'-a-j:i-b:il) if they do anything to [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112517-excess.org][excess]], and if all efforts to correct or reform them are to no avail. Thus, one can be an incorrigible idealist, an incorrigible criminal, an incorrigible [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112517-optimist.org][optimist]], or an incorrigible [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112517-philanderer.org][philanderer]]. The word derives from Latin ~corrigo~, to correct or set straight, plus the negative prefix in-. (This prefix, depending on the root it precedes, may be negative, may intensify the root, as ill invaluable, or may mean in.)
- The noun is [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112517-incorrigibility.org][incorrigibility]] (in-kawr'-:i-j:i-BIL'-:i-tee) or, alternatively, incorrigibleness.
**** veterans
- [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112517-inveterate.org][Inveterate]], from Latin ~vetus~, old,* generally indicates disapproval. 
- Inveterate gamblers have grown old in the habit, etymologically speaking; inveterate drinkers have been [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112517-imbibing.org][imbibing]] for so long that they, too, have formed old, well-established habits; and inveterate liars have been lying for so long, and their ~habits~- are by now so deep-rooted, that one can [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112517-scarcely.org][scarcely]] remember (the word implies) when they ever told the truth.
- The noun is [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112517-inveteracy.org][inveteracy]] (in-VET'-:ir-:i-see) or inveterateness. 
- A [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112517-veteran.org][veteran]] (VET'-:i-r:in), as of the Armed Forces, grew older serving the country; otherwise a veteran is an old hand at the game (and therefore skillful). The word is both a noun and an adjective: a veteran at (or in) swimming, tennis, police work, business, negotiations, diplomacy-or a veteran actor, teacher, diplomat, political reformer.
#+begin_quote
- Latin [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112517-senex.org][senex]], source of [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112408-senile.org][senile]] and [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112408-senescent.org][senescent]], also, you will recall, means old. In inveterate, in means ill; it is not the negative prefix found. in incorrigible.
#+end_quote
**** birth
Greek ~genesis~, birth or origin, a root we discovered in discussing psychogenic (Chapter 5), is the source of a great many English words.
[[file:./EnglishWord/2020112517-genetics.org][Genetics]] (j:i-NET'-iks) is the science that treats of the transmission of [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112517-hereditary.org][hereditary]] characteristics from parents to offspring.
The scientist specializing in the field is a geneticist (ja-NET'-:i-sist), the adjective is genetic (j:i-NET'-ik). The particle in the chromosome of the germ cell containing a hereditary characteristic is a gene ( JEEN).
[[file:./EnglishWord/2020112608-genealogy.org][Genealogy]] (jeen'-ee-AL'-:i-jee) is the study of family trees or ancestral origins (logos, study). The practitioner is a genealogist (jeen'-ee-AL'-a-jist). Can you form the adjective? - - - - - - - - - - - - · (And can you pronounce it?)
- The [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112608-genital.org][genital]] (GEN'-:i-tal), or sexual, organs are involved in the process of conception and birth. The [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112608-genesis.org][genesis]] (JEN'-:i-sis) of any- thing-a plan, idea, thought, career, etc.-is its beginning, birth, or origin, and Genesis, the first book of the Old Testament, describes the creation, or birth, of the universe. Congenital is constructed by combining the prefix ~con-~, with or together, and the root [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112608-genesis.org][genesis]], birth.
- So a congenital defect; deformity, condition, etc. occurs during the nine-month birth process (or period of gestation, to become technical). Hereditary (h:i-RED'-:i-tair'-ee) characteristics, on the other hand, are acquired at the moment of [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112213-conception.org][conception]]. Thus, eye color, nose shape, hair texture, and other such qualities are [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112517-hereditary.org][hereditary]]; they are determined by the genes in the germ cells of the mother and father. But a thalidomide baby resulted from the use of the drug by a pregnant woman, so the deformities were congenital.
- Congenital is used both literally and figuratively. Literally, the word generally refers to some medical deformity or abnormality occurring during gestation. Figuratively, it wildly [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112608-exaggerates.org][exaggerates]], for effect, the very early existence of some quality: congenital liar, congenital fear of the dark, etc.
** SESSION 16
*** ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS
**** of time and place
- A chronic liar lies constantly, again and again and again; a chronic [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112608-invalid.org][invalid]] is ill time after time, frequently, repeatedly. The derivation of the word is Greek [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112608-chronos.org][chronos]], time. The noun form is chronicity (kra-NIS'-a-tee).
- An [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112608-anachronism.org][anachronism]] (a-NAK'-ra-niz~m) is someone or something out of time, out of date, belonging to a different era, either earlier or later. (The prefix ~ana-~ like ~a-~, is negative.) The adjective is [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112608-anachronous.org][anachronous]] (a-NAK'-ra-nas) or [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112608-anachronistic.org][anachronistic]] (a-nak'-ra-NIS'- tik). .
- Wander along Fifty-ninth Street and Central Park in Manhattan some Sunday. You will see horse--drawn carriages with top-hatted coachmen--a [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112609-vestige.org][vestige]] of the 1800s. Surrounded by twentieth-century motorcars and modern skyscrapers, these romantic vehicles of a [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112609-bygone.org][bygone]] era are anachronous.
- Read a novel in which a scene is supposedly taking place in the nineteenth century and see one of the characters turning on a TV set. An [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112608-anachronism.org][anachronism]]!
- Your friend talks, thinks, dresses, and acts as if he were living in the time of Shakespeare. Another anachronism!
- Science fiction is deliberately anachronousit deals with phenomena, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112609-gadgetry.org][gadgetry]], accomplishments far off (possibly) in the future.
- An anachronism is out of time; something out of place is [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112609-incongruous.org][incongruous]] (in-KONG'-groo-as), a word combining the negative prefix ~in-~, the prefix ~con-, with or together, and a Latin verb meaning to agree or correspond.
- Thus, it is incongruous to wear a sweater and slacks to a formal wedding; it is anachronous to wear the wasp waist, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112609-conspicuous.org][conspicuous]] [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112609-bustle.org][bustle]], or powdered [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112609-wig.org][wig]] of the eighteenth century. The noun form of incongruous is incongruity (in-kang-GRd<Y~a-tee).
- Chronological (kron-a-LOJ'-a-kal), in correct time order, comes from chronos. To tell a story chronologically is to relate the events in the time order of their occurrence. Chronology (kra- NOL'-a-jee) is the science of time order and the accurate dating of events (logos, science)-;the expert in this field is a chronologist (kra-NOL'-a-jist)-or a list of events in the time order in
- which they have occurred or will occur.
- A [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112609-chronometer.org][chronometer]] (kra-NOM'-a-tar), combining chronos with metron, measurement, is a highly accurate timepiece, especially one used on ships. Chronometry (kra-NOM'-a-tree) is the measurement of time---the adjective is chronometric (kron'-a-MET'-rik).
- Add the prefix ~syn-~, together, plus the verb suffix -ize, to chronos, and you have constructed [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112609-synchronize.org][synchronize]] (SIN'-kra-niz'), etymologically to time together, or to move, happen, or cause to happen, at the same time or rate. If you and your friend synchronize your watches, you set them at the same time. If you synchronize the activity of your arms and legs, as in swimming, you move them at the same time or rate. The adjective is synchronou$ (SIN' -kr:i-n:is) ; the noun form of the verb synchronize is syn- chronization (sin' -kr:i-n:i-ZA Y' -sh:in).
**** disease, suffering, feeling
- [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112609-pathological.org][Pathological]] is diseased (a pathological condition)-this meaning of the word ignores the root ~logos~, science, study.
- [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112610-pathology.org][Pathology]] (p:i-THOL'-:i-jee) is the science or study of diseaseits nature, cause, cure, etc. However, another meaning of the noun ignores ~logos~, and pathology may be any [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112109-morbid.org][morbid]], diseased, or abnormal physical condition or conditions; in short, simply disease, as in "This case involves so many kinds of pathology that several different specialists are working on it."
- A [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112609-pathologist.org][pathologist]] (p:i-THOL'-:i-jist) is an expert who examines tissue, often by [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112610-autopsy.org][autopsy]] or [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112415-biopsy.org][biopsy]], to diagnose disease and interpret the abnormalities in such tissue that may be caused by specific diseases.
- Pathos occurs in some English words with the additional meaning of feeling. If you feel or suffer with someone, you are [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112609-sympathetic.org][sympathetic]] (sim-p:i-THET'-ik)--~sym-~ is a [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112609-respelling.org][respelling]] before the letter p of the Greek prefix ~syn-~, with or together. The noun is sympathy (SIM'-p:i-thee), the verb [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112609-sympathize.org][sympathize]] (SIM'-p:i-thTz). Husbands, for example, so the story goes, may have [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112609-sympathetic.org][sympathetic]] labor pains when their wives are about to deliver.
- The prefix ~anti-~, you will recall, means against. If you experience [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112609-antipathy.org][antipathy]] (an-TIP'-:i-thee) to people or things, you feel against them-you feel strong dislike or [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112609-hostility.org][hostility]]. The adjective is [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112609-antipathetic.org][antipathetic]] (an'-t:i-p:i-THET'-ik), as in "an antipathetic reaction to an authority figure."
- But you may have no feeling at all-just indifference, lack of any interest, emotion, or response, complete [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112609-listlessness.org][listlessness]], especially when some reaction is normal or expected. Then you are [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112609-apathetic.org][apathetic]] (ap-;;i-THET'-ik); a-, as you know, is a negative prefix. The noun is apathy (AP'-:i-thee), as in voter apathy, student apathy, etc.
- On the othe hand, you may be so sensitive or perceptive that not only share the feelings of another, but you also [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112609-identify.org][identify]] with those feelings, in fact experience them yourself as if [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112609-momentarily.org][momentarily]] you were that other per8on. What you have, then, is empathy (EM'-pa-thee); you empathize. (EM'-pa-thiz'), you are [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112609-empathetic.org][empathetic]] (em-pa-THET'-ik), or, to use an alternate adjective, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112609-empathic.org][empathic]] (em-PATH'-ik). ~Em-~ is a respelling before the letter p of the Greek prefix ~en-~, in.
- Someone is [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112609-pathetic.org][pathetic]] (pa-THET'-ik) who is obviously suffering -such a person may [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112609-arouse.org][arouse]] [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112609-sympathy.org][sympathy]] or pity (or perhaps antipathy?) in you. A pathetic story is about suffering and, again, is likely to arouse sadness, [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112609-sorrow.org][sorrow]], or [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112609-pity.org][pity]]. .
- Some interesting research was done many years ago by Dr. J. B. Rhine and his associates at Duke University on [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112610-extrasensory.org][extrasensory]] perception; you will find an interesting account of Rhine's work in his book The Reach of the Mind. What makes it possible for two people separated by miles of space to communicate with each other without recourse to messenger, telephone, telegraph, or [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112610-postal.org][postal]] service? It can be done, say the believers in telepathy (ta-LEP'-a- thee), also called mental telepathy; though they do not yet [[file:./EnglishWord/2020110314-admit.org][admit]] to knowing how. How can one person read the mind of another?
- Simplebly being [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112610-telepathic.org][telepathic]] (tel-a-PATH'-ik), but no one can explain the chemistry or biology of it. Telepathy is built by combining pathos, feeling, with the ~prefix~ ~tele-~ distance, the same ~prefix~ we found in telephone, telegraph, telescope.
- [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112611-telepathic.org][Telepathic]] (tel-a-PATH'-ik) communication occurs when people can feel each other's thoughts from a distance, when they have ESP.

- Psychopaths commit antisocial and unconscionable acts~they are not troubled by conscience, guilt, remorse, etc. over what they have done.
- Unconscionable and conscience are related in derivation-the first word from Latin scio, to know, the second from Latin sciens, knowing, and both using the prefix con-, with, together.
- Etymologically, then, your conscience is your knowledge with a moral sense of right and wrong; if you are unconscionable, your conscience is not (un-) working, or you have no conscience. The
when surrounded by people-such a person is gregarious (gra- GAIR'-ee-:is).
- Extroverts are of course gregarious-they prefer human con- tact, conversation, laughter, interrelationships, to solitude.
- The suffix -ness, as you know, can be added to an adjective to construct a noun form. Write the noun for gregarious: ·;
- Add the prefix con-, with, together, to grex, gregis, to get the verb congregate (KONG'-gr:i-gayt'); add the prefix se-, apart, to build the verb segregate (SEG'-r:i-gayt'); add the prefix ad-, to, toward (ad- changes to ag- before a root starting with g-), to con- struct the verb aggregate (AG-r:i-gayt').
- Let's see what we have. When people gather together in a herd or flock, they (write the v e r b ) - - - - - - - - - - - The noun is congregation (cong'-gr:i-GAY'-sh:in), one of the meanings of which is a religious "flock."
- Bring individual items to or toward the herd or flock; and you (write the verb) them. What is the noun form of this v e r b ? - - - - - - - - - - - -
- The verb aggregate also means to come together to or toward the herd, that is, to gather into a mass or whole, or by extension, to total or amount to. So aggregate, another noun form, pro- nounced AG'-r:i-g:it, is a group or mass of individuals considered as a whole, a herd, or a flock, as in the phrase "people in the aggregate ..•

* HOW TO TALK ABOUT ACTIONS
** SESSION 19
- Verbs are [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112613-incalculably.org][incalculably]] useful to you .
- Every sentence you think, say, read, or write contains an implied or expressed verb, for it is the verb that carries the action, the movement, the force of your ideas.
- As a young child, you used verbs fairly early.
- Your first words, of course, were probably ~nouns~, as you identified the things or people around you.
- Mama, Dada, doll, baby, bottle, etc. perhaps were the first standard syllables you [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112613-uttered.org][uttered]], for naming [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112613-concrete.org][concrete]] things or real persons is the initial step in the development of language.
- Soon there came the ability to express [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112414-intangible.org][intangible]] ideas, and then you began to use simple verbs--go, stop, stay, want, eat, sleep, etc.
- As you gained maturity, your verbs expressed ideas of greater and greater [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112514-complexity.org][complexity]]; as an adult you can describe the most involved actions in a few simple syllables--if you have a good store of useful verbs at your command.
- The richer and more extensive your vocabulary of verbs, the more accurately and expressively you can communicate your understanding of actions, reactions, attitudes, and emotions. Let's be specific.
** IDEAS
**** playing it down
- Ready to go back thirty or more years? Consider some post World War II American political history:
- Harry Truman couldn't. win the 1948 election. The [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112614-pollsters.org][pollsters]] said so, the Republicans heartily agreed, even the Democrats,some in high places, believed it. Mr. Truman himself was perhaps the only voter in the country who was not entirely [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112614-convinced.org][convinced]].
- Came the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November-well, if you were one of those who stayed up most of the night listening to the returns, and then kept your ear to the radio most of the next day, you recall how you reacted to the unique Truman triumph.
- It was no mean accomplishment, thought many people. Pure accident, said others. If one out of twelve voters in a few key states had changed his ballot, Harry could have gone back to selling ties, one Republican apologist pointed out. It wasn't anything Truman did, said another; it was what Dewey didn't do. No credit to Truman, said a third; it was the farmers-or Iabor--or the Republicans· who hadn't bothered to vote-or the ingenious mis- counting of ballots. No credit to Truman, bisisted a fourth; it was Wallace's candidacy-it was the DemOcrats-it was Republican overconfidence--it was sunspots-it was the Communists-it was the civil service workers who didn't want to lose their cushy jobs -it was really [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112613-roosevelt.org][Roosevelt]] who won the election.
- Anyway Harry didn't accomplish a thing-he was just a victim of good fortune.
- What were the apologists for Dewey's failure doing?
They were [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112613-disparaging.org][disparaging]] Truman's achievement.
**** playing it safe
- Willing to look at some more history of the late 1940s?
- Of course, [[file:./EnglishWord/2021010819-dewey.org][Dewey]] did campaign, in his own way, for the [[file:./EnglishWord/2021010819-presidency.org][presidency]]. As the Republican [[file:./EnglishWord/2021010819-aspirant.org][aspirant]], he had to take a stand on the controversial Taft-Hartley Act.
- Was he for it? He was for that part of it which was good. Naturally, he was against any of the provisions which were bad. Was he for it? The answer was yes-and also no. Take whichever answer you wanted most to hear.
- What was Dewey doing?
- He was [[file:./EnglishWord/2021010819-equivocating.org][equivocating]]

**** enjoying the little things
- Have you ever gone through a book that was so good you kept hugging yourself mentally as you read? Have you ever seen a play or motion picture that was so charming that you felt [[file:./EnglishWord/2021010819-sheer.org][sheer]] delight as you watched? Or perhaps you have had a portion of [[roam:pumpkin(南瓜)chiffon]] pie, light and airy and mildly [[file:./EnglishWord/2021010819-flavored.org][flavored]], and with a [[file:./EnglishWord/2021010819-flaky.org][flaky]], delicious crust(外壳), that was the last word in [[file:./EnglishWord/2021010819-gustatory.org][gustatory]] enjoyment?
- Now notice the examples I have used. I have not spoken of books that [[file:./EnglishWord/2021010819-grip.org][grip]] you emotionally, of plays and movies that keep you on the edge of your seat in [[file:./EnglishWord/2021010819-suspense.org][suspense]] suspened(悬挂的), or of food that satisfies a [[file:./EnglishWord/2021010820-ravenous.org][ravenous]] hunger. These would offer quite a different, perhaps more lasting and memorable, type of enjoyment. I have detailed, rather, mental or physical stimuli that excite enjoyably but not too sharply-a delightful novel, a charming play, a delicious dessert.
- How do such things affect you?
- They [[file:./EnglishWord/2021010820-titillate.org][titillate]] you.
**** playing it way up
- You know how the teen-agers of an earlier generation adored, idolized, and overwhelmed Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, the Beatles?
- And of course you know how certain people fall all over visiting celebrities---best-selling authors, much publicized artists, or famous entertainers. They show them [[file:./EnglishWord/2021010820-ingratiating.org][ingratiating]], almost servile attention, worship and [[file:./EnglishWord/2021010820-flatter.org][flatter]] them fulsomely.
- How do we say it in a single word?
- They [[file:./EnglishWord/2021010820-adulate.org][adulate]] such celebrities.
**** [[file:./EnglishWord/2021010820-accentuating.org][accentuating]] the negative
- What docs the doctor say to you if you have low blood sugar? "No candy, no pastries(点心,🧁糕点), no chocolate marshmallow(棉花糖) cookies, no icecream!", your [[file:./EnglishWord/2021010820-morale.org][morale]] dropping lower and lower.as each favorite goody is placed on the forbidden list.
- What, in one word, is the doctor doing?
- The doctor is proscribing harmful items in your diet.
#+begin_quote
Fulsome (FOOL'·s:im) does not mean, despite its appearance, fully or completely, but rather, offensive because of excessiveness or insincerity, often in reference to compliments, praise, admiration, or [[file:./EnglishWord/2021010820-flattery.org][flattery]].
#+end_quote

**** accentuating the [[file:./EnglishWord/2021010820-affirmative.org][affirmative]]
- You are warm, friendly, enthusiastic, outgoing, easy to please; you are quick to show appreciation, yet accept, without judgment or criticism, the human weaknesses of others.
- You are a fascinating talker, an even better listener.
- You believe in, and practice, honest sell-disclosure; you feel comfortable with yourself and therefore with everyone else; and you have a passionate interest in experiencing, in living, in relating to people.
- Need you have any fears about making friends? Obviously not Your characteristics and temperament [[file:./EnglishWord/2020112618-obviate.org][obviate]] such fears
**** playing it wrong
- Theodor Reik, in his [[file:./EnglishWord/2021010820-penetrating.org][penetrating]] book on psychoanalysis(精神分析) Listening with the Third Ear, talks about neurotic people who unconsciously wish to fail. In business interviews they say exactly the wrong words, they do exactly the wrong things, they seem intent (as, unconsciously, they actually are) on insuring failure in every possible way, though consciously they are doing their best to court success.
- What effect does such a neurotic [[file:./EnglishWord/2021010820-tendency.org][tendency]](趋势癖好) have?
- It militates against success.

**** playing it dirty
- "Harry?" He's a [[file:./EnglishWord/2021010820-closet.org][closet]] [[file:./EnglishWord/2021010820-alcoholic.org][alcoholic]](酒精?). [[file:./EnglishWord/2021010820-maud.org][Maud]]? She's sleeping around -'and her stupid husband doesn't suspect a thing. Bill? He's [[file:./EnglishWord/2021010820-embezzling.org][embezzling]] from his own company. Paul? He's a child [[file:./EnglishWord/2021010820-molester.org][molester]]. [[file:./EnglishWord/2021010820-satty.org][Satty]]? You don't know that she's a notorious husband-beater?''
- What is this character doing?
- He's [[file:./EnglishWord/2021010820-maligning.org][maligning]] everyone.

**** giving the benefit of any doubt
- Do you think it's all right to cheat on your income taxes? At least just a little? It's wrong, of course, but doesn't everybody do it?
- How do you feel about [[file:./EnglishWord/2021010820-marital.org][marital]] infidelity? Are you inclined to overlook the occasional [[file:./EnglishWord/2021010820-philandering.org][philandering]] of the male partner, since, after all, to invent a [[file:./EnglishWord/2021010820-cliche.org][cliche]], men are essentially polygamous by nature?
- If your answers are in the affirmative, how are you reacting to such legal or ethical [[file:./EnglishWord/2021010820-transgressions.org][transgressions]]? 
You [[file:./EnglishWord/2021010820-condone.org][condone]] them.
**** changing hostility
- Unwittingly you have done something that has [[file:./EnglishWord/2021010820-aroused.org][aroused]] anger and resentment in your best friend. You had no desire to hurt him, yet he makes it obvious that be feels pretty [[file:./EnglishWord/2021010820-bitter.org][bitter]] about the whole situation. (Perhaps you failed to invite him to a gathering he wanted to come to; or you neglected to consult him before making a decision on a matter in which be felt be should have some say.) His friendship is valuable to you and you wish to re- store yourself in his good graces. What do you do?
- You try to [[file:./EnglishWord/2021010820-placate.org][placate]] him.
